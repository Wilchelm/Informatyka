28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall.
The victim's brother testified that he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm him, saying, "He finally got back on his feet."
The body found Wednesday morning at the Westfield Mall was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia of San Francisco, the San Francisco Department of Forensic Medicine said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was being treated as homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told San Francisco station KGO that Frank, who used to work as a chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him dearly," the spokesman added.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that "things finally went up for him."
'He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend, 'Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us something, prepare us dinner, "Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of altercation.
He was the brother who swam with the stream.
"With everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond that shone brightly every day," he said.
Anyone with information on the case is asked to call the SFPD's tip line at 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always pigeonholed
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has now made that abundantly clear in an interview.
'I'm always pigeonholed or labelled from the outside, which usually have little to do with me and reality. '
'I don't want to be perfect and successful all the time. '
'To be honest, I don't really care about those things. '
Jennifer Aniston, 47, can only laugh at being called "Miss Perfect," as she explains in the latest issue of Cosmopolitan.
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of the TV with a loose bun and Mexican food, the magazine said.
She added: 'We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect,' the Hollywood star said.
In her new film, "Mother's Day," Aniston stars as a single mother of two sons.
The film will be released on August 25.
Golfer Langer receives the Sports Pyramid
His experience on the horse is manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer was looking for some variety with a ride on the beach.
It was a first for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their end of the day, they galloped home to the feeding troughs.
One kilometer at this speed, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," Langer said.
And with that the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was back near horses.
He and his family were led around the grounds of the ALRV, he did not even swing on a horse for photo purposes.
Langer was in Aachen for the first time and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German Sports Aid presented the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sports Pyramid at a small gala.
The personable sportsman has no shortage of awards.
Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Laurel Leaf, Champions Tour Player of the Year...
Even the British Queen has ennobled him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
On Saturday he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler in Aachen.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting success, but also for social commitment."
Langer has been promoting young talent for decades.
And so he immediately passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
The two-time US Masters winner was inducted into the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday along with 15 other outstanding athletes.
Among the winners are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, bobsleigh rider Meinhard Nehmer, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the show jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handball player Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sporting legends came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company went to the jumping stadium, where the Lavazza Prize was presented.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big beasts.
Clintons and Trump's Economic Policy Comparison: It's All About the Money
Investing in infrastructure and blocking the TTP trade deal is what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy, as well as on a matter of principle.
Underlying the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The, about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep them small, warning of how government can hurt the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself, however, would be very different, Trump claims.
He will massively scale back regulations, and he is pushing for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says the state has certain tasks to perform, it has opportunities for the disadvantaged, and it needs money to do so.
That's why taxes would be raised on the rich, she says.
Interestingly, the two are very close on infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say almost word for word on the need to invest.
The Democratic candidate even announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.
Government infrastructure investment programs are classic Democratic policies and are strongly opposed by, say, the anti-government tea party wing of the Republican Party.
So Trump could still face intra-party discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and ramp up coal production in the US.
Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, and he wants to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand renewable energy with her investment program, saying, "A country will become a clean-energy superpower and create millions of jobs."
'It's going to be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be. '
But it's not just infrastructure - the two rivals are not too far apart on international trade agreements, either.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, neither wants to sign.
At the same time, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - they just want to better protect American jobs.
They should be better paid, Clinton says.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a pittance.
She wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: once he says the minimum wage must go up, then he says it must not be changed.
But the big discussion in the coming months is likely to revolve more around the tax policies of the two camps.
On one side is Trump, who wants to ease the burden on the economy and citizens to boost growth.
His critics accuse him of only widening the budget deficit.
On the other side is Clinton, who wants to at least require the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say that more taxes are not the solution.
Escape: "Every refugee woman has experience of sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost an everyday occurrence for women fleeing alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.
A house offers refuge.
Four women sit in a large kitchen.
Each has a baby with them, who is not more than one year old.
One held her young son in her arms.
He looks curiously into the room with wide eyes.
His mother stares at the tabletop.
Until she realises she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the managing director of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals, among other things, with the subject of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised shelters for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
It was recently officially opened.
There are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a security guard at the door.
"It is not an exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence while on the run," says Bahr.
"Men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as bearers of hope," she says.
For women, other reasons for fleeing predominate: "Many steal away secretly because they see no other way out."
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives them on.
On the run, it continues.
"It is not uncommon for smugglers to demand a sexual act for a bottle of water, for example," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Those who believe that the end will come as soon as they arrive in Germany are mistaken, says Bahr.
Here too, single women in refugee shelters are often regarded as inferior and, at worst, abused.
As a result, about 90 percent of the women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
'Some of the children certainly weren't born voluntarily. '
Many women are so used to not saying anything.
'Or they don't dare speak openly about what they've experienced because the shame is too great. '
Since they often do not know how to help themselves, more accommodation is needed just for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees.
When asked whether they were aware of a project similar to the one in Munich in their area of responsibility, some answered no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Even in Swabia, women who have fled alone are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman for the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower Franconia and Middle Franconia, in some shared accommodation there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be housed separately from men.
A study published for the committee said: 'It is very important that men and women are housed separately.'
"If there is a lack of privacy or if men and women are accommodated together, violence against women can occur - on an ongoing basis."
Above all, the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible for women, the study says.
The extent to which the women feel this need for protection can be seen from the crush on the house in Munich.
"We've had a long waiting list since word got around that we were there," Bahr says.
You could easily open a second house.
Junior doctors strike: Calls for new industrial action
Assistant doctors' representatives have called on their union to approve new industrial action in their dispute over a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire council to approve more industrial action from early September.
The JDC said ministers had failed to address concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "stubbornly quiet" on issues that led to the contract being rejected.
She said: 'In light of this, the JDC board has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and has requested formal renegotiation of all your concerns.'
In response to the government's silence, the JDC board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating industrial action starting in early September.
The disputes led to junior doctors striking six times this year, the first total stoppages in NHS history.
The head of the BMA's junior doctors, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote to reject the agreed contract terms recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members during meetings held before the vote by 54,000 junior doctors and medical students that the contract was advantageous and should be adopted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be compulsory for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: An "alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met Tuesday to shake hands and announce an official end to an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot help feeling that Ankara most wants this reconciliation.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed narrow-lipped, and he exuded little warmth, even by his low-key standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly referred to his "dear friend" Putin - five times, according to one report.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis levels, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described Erdogan as behaving as if nothing bad had ever happened.
To me, his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.
But a sustained coolness radiated by Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin issued a statement accusing Ankara of stabbing Russia in the back.
The offence was even greater as it was committed by an alleged friend.
Rebuilding trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a ferocious, unrestrained attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead.
After all, that meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia had some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan needs all the friends he can get, first and foremost, after he was nearly impeached in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights resume.
They are counting on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
As one report in Vedemosti put it: "Tourists long there, tomatoes long here."
But the visit had added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West, seeing its response to the attempted takeover as a weak response.
Add to that lingering resentment about the snail's pace of EU accession negotiations, and Putin - eager to capitalize on the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit in this splendid seaside palace enabled Russia and Turkey to portray what one analyst once described to me as an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West and are now allied.
Yet, despite the public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently assumed the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be telling that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents testified at the news conference that they had not even touched on the issue.
Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator on Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for total disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand is to be reduced to a back-office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself since it nearly collapsed and had to be bailed out eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer financial brands.
She has backed international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, devolved headquarters and listing will move to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used by customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller retail brands that will gain more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed by customers and staff in Inverness-shire during a sightseeing tour.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our staff will be employed as we become more of a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global objectives, but local objectives.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities, and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already said it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to become the Bank of Brands, because how do we focus internally (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" the chief executive said.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see a lot of change.
We can re-launch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori claims his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that earned him 3,000th win
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, at his local track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in flat racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
Three-time winner Dettori, who previously won on Ghayyar, said: 'It's special.'
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humbled.
Dettori takes the cheer as he takes victory on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in steeplechasing - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who racked up more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner, had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong but it is his tactical intellect that sets him apart from the others in the weight room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing and his enthusiasm and charisma has been inspiring fans for years.
I told Frankie at Epsom a few weeks ago that if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey, he would have won 6,000 already!
Frankie has ridden winners in the UK for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the figurehead of British Flat racing for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A string of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was banned for drugs.
Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from his six-month suspension, but he showed impressive strength of character to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he is far from finished - Dettori has previously said he wants to continue competing until he is at least 50.
Russia's Putin fires chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's inner circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport Affairs.
A Kremlin statement said Putin had "ordered Ivanov's dismissal from his duties as chairman of Russia's presidential administration," without giving reasons.
Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
The Kremlin's website says (in Russian) that he was later chief of protocol and chief of staff to government staff.
Of his appointment, he told Putin: 'Thank you for your trust.'
I believe that the most important task of the government is to support your work as Head of State in drafting laws and monitoring the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces convincing?
The move has shrouded Moscow in secrecy.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and, like him, works for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a televised meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the chief of staff was resigning at his own request.
But despite smiling for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the general election.
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy - was met with deep skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that in early 2012, in a conversation, I asked you to entrust me with this very complicated - one might almost say arduous - post for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He was previously deputy prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB state security service.
In the late 1990 "s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, because a third term would have violated the constitution.
But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before being re-elected president three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after slamming producers
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played special agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized on Thursday before announcing his termination.
There were artistic differences and disagreements on set.
I regret the incident, 'he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be written out of the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to the statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been with the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put all my heart and soul into it for the last 12 years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will not be possible now.
I would just like to thank the writers, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and most of all the best fans you could wish for a show.
The twelfth season is scheduled to air on September 28.
Mystery over fish that ended up in garden in Banff
A Banff resident called for help identifying the fish that turned up in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels spewed from a fountain.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, posted a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone might shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now linked to Fife
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blowers," which are nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.
The Fife bridge section is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete, as well as 46 cables.
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown paid a visit to the site today and was one of the first to walk from the land to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing an engineering feat of truly epic proportions on this project with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are in place and the last section of the deck is now being cast in concrete for the deck at Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project manager, said: "The first closure is a significant milestone in any bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents pioneering construction and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last section of the road deck and its connection to the north tower deck, which is under construction, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.
It was tricky because the tolerances the team was working towards were tiny - they were only a few millimetres on each side.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Moelfre Bay rescue: Three men "lucky to be alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after being thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station raised the alarm at 13: 20 BST on Friday after a crew observed the incident at Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming to safety as their boat continued to move on its own.
"We saw the boat turn around near them and imagined the worst," said Moelfre Rescue Station Chief Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong winds had already blown the boat out of reach by the time we got to the water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged in his 60s, was found exhausted and hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
They all got on board the lifeboat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said: 'The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be uninjured and still alive.
The boat engine had an emergency stop line, but when the boat capsized, it detached from the person who was steering the boat.
Someone was watching over these men today.
Seriously injured man stabs his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend with a knife in Hamburg-Harburg and seriously injured her.
Police said yesterday that the 50-year-old had been given the keys to the flat to retrieve his personal belongings.
Instead, the alcoholic offender cut up his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When she came to the flat, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old suffered injuries to her hand and body.
Police were able to arrest the offender.
While destroying his ex-girlfriend's clothes, the 50-year-old called his mother.
She then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
But she could not persuade him to leave the apartment.
So she left the house with her partner.
They met the man's ex-partner in the street.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds affordable housing?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be held much more accountable in future.
How to react to the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 affordable homes in the next few years?
The SPD is proposing a "housing action plan" for the next council meeting.
But controversy is inevitable.
First and foremost, the question is: who is actually going to build the affordable housing?
There is no regulation so far.
SPD parliamentary group chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens that anyone who wants to build on urban land will have to designate 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also be built in existing buildings.
But the big point of contention at City Hall, Bratmann said, is: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 per cent, but preferably 20 per cent, of social housing on such sites."
A new urban housing incentive program, which will cost millions and has yet to be financed, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, Bratmann said, is that "there is no agreement between the groups at the moment."
The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible for investors.
The left wants even tougher restrictions on investors.
Nonetheless, Bratmann said, the situation in the housing market is worsening.
If the action plan is implemented, this will provide for additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff are needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.
But the program is not yet complete: the roughly 1260 new apartments that were supposed to be built anyway.
But how do you compensate for the loss of another 1,300 affordable homes, whose subsidies will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 homes.
Planning spokeswoman Nicole Palm said expiring bonds should now be purchased by the city to prevent that from happening.
Consideration should also be given to bringing homes back into price fixing.
This is possible in the western city.
The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.
In the western city, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back into the price fixing for low-cost apartments.
But that is not what the owners, the housing associations, want.
If the number of social housing units in the western city is increased drastically again, one moves away from the goal of so-called mixing.
There should no longer be a concentration of socially disadvantaged people in just a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must be on board."
It has focused on more construction sites for single-family homes.
This does not mean, however, that a compromise cannot be reached after all.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
It is fascinating to watch how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off their couches and getting them more active.
Time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and finally to smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I'm referring, of course, to the Pokémon Go craze, an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s (later turned into an animated series, playing cards, and other spin-offs).
Like many pop culture phenomena, interest dropped slightly before the game's release in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand, which overloaded the servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones looking for Pokémons that can be tracked by GPS and, once found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on their phone) or "captured."
A generation who played the game when they were younger joined the craze and jumped off the sofa in search.
In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps the "average" person takes each day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told The Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people tracked exercising for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees the raw data to boost performance.
Many public health education campaigns aimed at getting people to "take 30 minutes," "get off the couch" and "be active every day" fell on deaf ears, because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overstated.
People who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people to do something outdoors that they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting.
As always, there are grumpy spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run into a door.
What's the point?
There has been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our activity in the past, they haven't given us a reason to exercise, as this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and use will decrease over time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Effortlessly on the beam.
Stunning on the ground.
Brilliant all round.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast ascended to the all-around title on Thursday, widening the gap between herself and the rest of the world under the Olympic spotlight.
Her overall score of 62.198 was well ahead of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
American gymnast Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the women's individual all-around gymnastics final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth straight American heterosexual to win an all-around title and fifth overall, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation, if not ever.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end in that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 golds - with such amazing routines that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
A final test awaited her in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes as between her and a load of outsized expectations.
Not returning with a handful of gold to the family in Spring, Texas, would be seen as a disappointment.
Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively in the women's all-around gymnastics final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles picked up her first medal on Tuesday while serving as an exclamation point at the farewell ceremony for retiring team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted she never planned for the future during her long road to the top, that's not really true.
Some of her floor exercises - which include her trademark tumbling pass - are tuned to Latin music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
This is no coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents as a young child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina led easily through two spins, the picture was deceptive.
Floating beams and floor gymnastics - where Biles holds the world title - lurked.
She caught up again with 15.433 on the balance beam - and added another with a 15.933 on the floor.
Raisman gently hugged her as they awaited their final result - a mere formality - and tears streamed down Biles' glossy red, white and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebreak.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, nicknamed "Grandma" by the Americans, had a head start.
After her floor routine, she threw kisses to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that at times seemed dubious.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's fast-spreading tweet from earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead while chatting in a car and listening to music in one of the deadliest attacks in Phoenix in a decade, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The offender fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, the report said.
Police said the triple murder does not appear to have been the result of a robbery as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that was in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting led investigators to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
In all, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in four months, mostly in Hispanic neighborhoods.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a CBS affiliate, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge casings and recovered a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: 'It's getting better'
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do this.
I can't do that.
I didn't get involved in that.
Which isn't true at all -- of course they did, "she said.
She and her husband Vincent have been told that Edmund may never be able to recognise them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest he should be institutionalised.
"My first response was, 'I didn't know people were still doing this,'" Picciuto said.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walking aid.
Edmund was unable to sit or crawl until he was three, and he still cannot speak.
But he is making slow progress.
He can walk and cycle with assistance.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund came up with for "Please sing something to me." "
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not typical sign language, she says. Edmund invented some signs on his own.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund's case, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary widely.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional cost of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what's going to happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis in a long time because I don't expect anyone to be able to really tell me.
But Picciuto has some hopeful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it's going to get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, flooding prompt rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday and more rain is expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened widespread flooding after heavy rains, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on its way to affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said the community of Tangipahoa alone had requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood warning system is in effect across much of southern Louisiana through Saturday.
The weather service said an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in the area.
A flood warning system was in place in southern Alabama on Friday, while rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said downstream flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger because it will flow slowly into Lake Maurepas over the rivers that have been trodden.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams were still plucking people from the floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said another stepson, who lives nearby, had warned him.
"We woke up and the water was pouring in," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high point of the river.
Hansford said he and his family members all have disabilities and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency responders rescued all three in a large military truck and took them to the nearest fire station in Gloster, where they remained until Friday.
Krautmann said the flooding had "spread rapidly" as heavy rains continued and that authorities were considering evacuation orders.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground had been soaked by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and street flooding caused residents to be rescued from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and classes to be canceled in five school districts.
CBS affiliate WWL reported that a councilwoman in Tangipahoa reported 200 homes flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which have now been flooded.
Community Superintendent Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets washed up by the floodwaters.
Emergency shelters have been set up in the towns of Amite and Hammond to house evacuees.
"Once the water starts to recede, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipahoa municipality, nearly two dozen roads were closed due to the flooding and sandbags were provided for residents hoping to keep the water out of their homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city council.
This appears to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said rain continued to fall on the Gulf Coast.
He said a handful of homes were reported flooded on Thursday, but none had been reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets," survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second time this week that a 6-year-old child has been shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents said Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including to the loin, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy's condition was listed as critical at a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy's family told the station he is expected to recover.
He should have started first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two aged 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, the station reported.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrator.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to have been crossfire between several gunmen.
Cartridge casings for assault rifles, traced to various assault rifles, littered the scene.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the sidewalk, there were pods.
There appear to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved, "Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit in the arm by a ricochet as she played outside her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is recovering and police are still searching for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I envision among the women's Olympic gymnastics team, and for more than one reason.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspirational to many young girls of color.
The structure of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team is finally reflecting the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected yet masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold in an individual all-around event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are at the pinnacle of the sport, but that is not how gymnastics classes across the country look.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it to the Olympic team.
They are the "last five" because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts on the team. Moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts are primarily in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for training, furnishings, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list goes on.
The majority of these gymnastics clubs are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.
The gymnasts receive all their training at these clubs and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez's coach, have both coached their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to make gymnastics more affordable and accessible to the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I set up my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
At my events, we provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to the youth who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong health benefits as well as academic and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that gets thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true representation of "Girl Power" by winning Olympic team gold and thank you for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to begin their journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors to stage further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the row over the changes by agreeing a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who voted in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt unveiled plans to force the contract, saying the NHS was in a "no man's land" and any further delay would be damaging to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are to be given a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's junior doctors committee, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
With just eight weeks left until the first group of doctors are covered by the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with reluctance by the government to get involved and sometimes deafening silence.
This followed a promise made by Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the imposition and address the concerns of junior doctors," he said.
If he fails to do so, junior doctors have made it clear they are prepared to take further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April saw almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments postponed as nurses and specialist doctors were brought in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line.
Ministers had hoped to end the row over the changes by approving the reformed contract with British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants better weekly pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who will be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employees, called on junior doctors to end the strike.
Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves nothing of the sort, but it puts strain on already overstretched teams and service providers and only causes concern, distress and disruption to patients, carers and their families."
Over the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Doctors and responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from work leave, training boxes, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about meeting the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-a-day drug that can lower heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2-a-day drug after authorities recommended it be given to more people for an extended period.
The anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
NHS regulator NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
NHS regulator NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people have a heart attack each year and a quarter of them have another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form plaques.
If the plaque breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, made by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.
The draft guidance from NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with twice-daily aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE health technology evaluation centre, said: 'Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences.'
Fear of another heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years, and the draft guidance does not recommend any treatment beyond that period.
Political correctness culture allows voter fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year following a government report into corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities being knowingly ignored, a damning government report revealed today.
Former Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles has launched a verbal attack on the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of "over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
The former integration and local government minister, who is now an anti-corruption king, said intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that police should be allowed to set up barricades outside polling booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry identification cards to prove their identity in elections.
At present, voters only have to give their name and address.
The report proposes to apply non-removable ink to a person's finger when they cast their vote, in order to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to municipal records and decisions by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not only to protect against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in east London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "campaigned on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him."
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of an imitation in which one person votes as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He said he was particularly alarmed by fraudulent postal ballots - in which older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including keeping ID cards to prove identity
His report said: "As evidence, pressure has been put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elderly, particularly communities of Pakistani or Bangladeshi origin.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had knowingly ignored such behaviour due to" politically correct "sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from processing postal ballot papers to stop "election harvests."
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and welfare fraud.
Consider options to ask voters for their ID before voting.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as they cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on applications for automatic postal votes.
Ban political activists from processing complete postal ballots and envelopes of absentee ballots.
Give police the power to set up barriers around polling stations.
An amendment to the law that facilitates charges of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Ban photography at polling stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in polling stations (except Wales).
Intensify training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls foul of the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astonishing" that no criminal charges have been brought following the Tower Hamlets case.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit due to a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty on a number of grounds - in accordance with the high standards of criminal procedure.
He also criticises the ineffective "tick-box" checks on town halls "electoral registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a warning sign.
Our country has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threaten that reputation.
Kate's cycling doppelganger and other famous doppelgangers of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics were outraged this week by French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proved to be an impressive doppelganger for the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete competing for gold this summer who has his own famous doppelganger - at least not if social media is to be believed.
In honour of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: US archery team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
Aside from Kate's cycling doppelganger, many people on the internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-list celebrity Leonardo DiCaprio.
US archery team member Brady Ellison has caused a Twitter storm after pictures emerged of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star.
In fact, the archer took to social media to share the craze, admitting that he's been told since he was a child that he looks like Leo.
'I don't see much resemblance myself, other than facial hair, 'Brady told the Huffington Post.
'He's a good-looking guy, so I take that as a compliment. '
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will no doubt come to the fore this year: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her big, expressive eyes, is said to be a doppelganger for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Up a gear: This user believes Nathan is the 'athletic version' of the Inception actor
Another enduring comparison has been drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than the sun-tanned skin and blonde hair of actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian has been described by fans as an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar facial shapes and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was delighted that others noticed the similarities
Theory put to the test: According to this user, there may be a reason for the pair's resemblance
One Twitter user declared her satisfaction that 'the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical.'
In fact, US soccer star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have incredibly similar facial shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, and gymnastics gold medallist Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful broad smile similar to that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-place finish in the 4x200m freestyle swimming relay outraged viewers of CBC's live coverage of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologise after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went off like a pig" and died during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he made his own comments at the end of the 4x200m freestyle relay.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentary team to add more "color," could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost touch, baby."
Too excited, went off like mad, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China" died like a pig "????
The idiot didn't realise they were still on air. '
Ai Yanhan of China was described in the final women's 4 x 200m freestyle swimming relay as: 'This little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost touch, baby.'
Criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter was swift and harsh, with many taking him to task
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: 'Wow, # ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists. # disgusted.
A short time later, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize that the comment was broadcast about a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened. '
CBC eventually apologized more than 90 times to people who responded to the remark on Twitter
Fellow commentator Scott Russell had to apologise on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and pasted his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be broadcast.
We were quick to apologise to our on-air viewers and our social media followers last night.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his remark by saying it was not his intention for it to be construed as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swim relay on the CBC Olympic broadcast," he said.
'I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not her as a person. '
Of course no disrespect was intended and I'm very sorry. '
Shoppers in Primark outraged by woman shamelessly trying on underwear in the middle of the store
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try on underwear.
To make matters worse, she checked what she looked like in it, took it off and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and tried on four pairs of underwear at a shop in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark store at Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone where the woman tried on the underwear before putting it back on the shelf
A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after the mystery woman tried on the underwear, 'she got dressed again and left the store without buying anything.'
She said: 'People couldn't believe what they were seeing.'
Standing in the middle of the sales floor, she took a pair of underpants from the display, took off her own tights and pants and tried them on.
<unk> wasn't even trying to find a more discreet place to do it - she was just standing there, cheeky like Oscar. '
'Everyone was staring as she took off her underwear, which she obviously didn't like because she put it back on the shelf. '
She repeated the same thing with three more undies before finally deciding she didn't like anything, getting dressed again and walking out.
<unk> didn't seem bothered that someone was watching her - or thinking about the person who might buy the underwear she'd tried on. '
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: 'How disgusting to think someone would take home underwear that someone else was wearing and that wasn't washed.'
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: 'I understand staff tried to pull the garments out of sale after she left - which is just as well.'
'I'd hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find that another woman was wearing them and taking them off and they weren't washed. '
A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of the incident which occurred at our Folkstone store on Tuesday 9 August.'
All eligible products have been withdrawn from sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Regardless of whether you are approached from the front or the back, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your predator.
When approached from behind, the first thing you should do is turn around so you can see your attacker and "get out of the line of fire," Mizrachi says.
Then grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting him in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him in the groin with your knee and twist the weapon out of his hands as the attacker writhes in pain. Hit him in the face with the barrel and move backwards while pointing the weapon at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight onto the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and pointing the weapon at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that in the event of a robbery, it is safest to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveller Ian Wright scrapes his tongue in Europe's dirtiest places for a guide
A British traveller put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test - by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.
Presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scraped his teeth on a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a flush button in a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to do.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," yielded some surprising results.
The thought of licking the flush button of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be utterly repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
During his tour of Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and health professionals about promoting gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his gut by travelling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railings at train stations to flushing toilets, the task definitely put his immune system to the test
In the film he said: 'Even as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, soil, worms and mud water.'
In the film he certainly lived up to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample swab showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was one Russian toilet he refused to lick after its luminometer count exceeded 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of fewer than 60
Mr Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio produced the travel film The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film, he says: 'It's like the worst thing I've smelled in a toilet.'
There is nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company is equipping Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help promote gut bacteria and the immune system.
Valio's senior vice president of snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We did crazy brainstorming sessions that ended with us saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a broader context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: 'Let me put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.'
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where it was quite difficult.
I'm glad we caught some of those dirty treats on film. '
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said that they use products containing lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
Anti-social family demolished council flat in Saltash, Cornwall
An anti-social family left their council flat after being fined £50,000 for terrorising their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked staff at the housing association found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls had gaping holes, wooden floorboards were ripped open, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.
The family have been relocated and are now believed to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works in property management at Cornwall Housing, said she feared the flat was beyond repair.
She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people here and I don't think people have to live that way.
There are many things to consider as this property is likely to be seen as a less attractive part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment at the time, and police said the terror the family inflicted included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was given an anti-social behaviour order in June.
Old rubbish was found in some rooms of the house, which may be demolished
Wooden floorboards have been ripped up at the property where drugs have been traded in the past
Neighbours said they saw her fighting in the street and regularly had to call the police
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The delisting was cheered by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made hell.
One testified: 'They didn't care about anyone.'
We lived next door to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are unbelievable.
'We couldn't sleep this morning. '
We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that!
Now that they are finally gone, it will be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager for Cornwall Housing, said the family had failed to co-operate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house, to which the police were regularly called, for 20 years
Rubbish and old toys were thrown down the overgrown side of the council house
He added: "It is disgraceful that the tenant has failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family, as delisting is always the last step Cornwall Housing takes into consideration.
This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and her actions must have been terrible for her neighbours to witness.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who have bravely approached us and provided us with the information.
I hope this development will provide some comfort to some neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the fire
Property management workers will now have to clear away piles of rubbish surrounding the house
In 2014 police raided the house and found more than 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash totalling £1,700.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possessing a Class B drug with intent to supply.
She claimed the money was for a headstone for her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being homeless, Tanya and her partner are now believed to be living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were daubed with graffiti.
Police say they will evict tenants who do not comply with house rules
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the delisting was a clear warning to other tenants who do not comply with house rules.
"This goes to those who think they can behave without self-reproach and to those who have been harmed by such behaviour," she said.
Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after low-flying military jet flies over beach
Sunbathers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane took an incredible dive
The Air Force said it was on a training flight but insisted there was no safety risk
This is the moment terrified tourists start to panic after a low-flying jet crashes over a crowded beach.
Dramatic video footage showed the military plane flying almost within touching distance of sunbathers on the beach in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Holidaymakers jumped to their feet as they understandably began to worry about the noise from the jet engines without first seeing what was coming through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: 'It flew really low twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash.'
Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and it felt like the plane was coming down on me.'
Tourists on Aveiro beach were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast, flying so low that it was the only way to detect them.
The spokesman said the jet was flying slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by nearby wildfires, but the Air Force insisted that safety was not compromised at any time.
Wildfires have ravaged parts of mainland Portugal this summer, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly so low due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke from the fire - which restricted his vision
The plane was on a training flight when the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worries against Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona will fight on Sunday for the first step towards winning the first title of the new football season.
The Catalans face Sevilla away in the Spanish Super Cup, with the return leg at the Nou Camp three days later.
The double winner will have to do without Neymar, who is competing in the Olympic football tournament with Brazil, in a showdown with the defeated Cup finalist and reigning Europa League champion.
Goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a knee ligament sprain in training, clearing the way for Barca to sign Claudio Bravo, at least for now.
The Chile international and Ter Stegen have been vying for Barcelona's number one status for the past two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far refrained from making a clear decision, leaving Bravo in the league but Ter Stegen in the lead in most other competitions.
Ahead of the first competitive game of the new season, there are doubts over the fitness of the Spanish champions, who were humiliated 4-0 by Liverpool in a friendly on Saturday.
Lionel Messi and Co were also unconvincing in their 3-2 friendly win over Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Sevilla, meanwhile, have to digest the 2-3 extra-time defeat by Real Madrid in the European Super Cup and are aiming for a second straight Supercopa de Espana triumph.
Barcelona are the record winners in the competition with 11 wins so far.
Ma Long in a league of her own to win table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - China's Ma Long is the new Olympic table tennis champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "defending champion" Zhang Jike 4: 0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The world number one thus won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour Finals and, of course, the Olympics.
Bronze went to Japan's Jun Mizutani.
As expected, the two Chinese made it to the final and won the title among themselves.
Thus it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would win the singles title under the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SVS-Lower Austrian Legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left to their own devices at the plate; they had no coaches with them between sets and during time-outs.
They had retreated to the stands and let their protégés loose on each other in a fair competition.
'I've played the matches so far for my country. '
"I'm playing for myself in the final," Zhang said.
After the match, gold and silver medalists posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma only really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent in the first set.
He then set the tempo at the plate, leaving Zhang with only 13 points overall.
Ma's superiority did not produce the anticipated rousing match.
But there were plenty of breathtaking ball swings nonetheless.
Mizutani won the match for bronze against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4: 1.
The Belarusian suffered a rib injury in his quarter-final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was then undergoing medical treatment and had to "ultimately" make do with tin.
By the way, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38 / 2004) and Jörgen Persson (42 / 2008) had finished fourth in the Olympic table tennis at a similar age.
Donald Trump admits' huge problems' on the campaign trail
US Republican leaders are plagued by massive worries about losing their majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses in his campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
It was a rare moment in which the normally cocky and confident multi-millionaire voiced anything but concern, correspondents reported.
After knocking 16 rivals within his own Republican camp out of the race, doubts are growing about his success in the fight for the White House.
"We have tremendous problems in Utah," Trump told evangelical Christians he asked for support in key states like Ohio, Florida and Virginia.
False reports about his candidacy were to blame, he resumed his well-known media scolding.
Republican strongholds wobble
Utah is usually a safe seat for Republicans.
According to a June SurveyUSA poll, Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton were tied.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not by the margin customary for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump, when asked how he would stop Clinton's advance, replied: "Just like I've done so far."
He added afterwards: "Either this will be successful or I will have a very nice, long holiday."
He did nothing but "tell the truth."
If it's not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, 'Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party has threatened to cut off funds to support Trump's campaign if he fails to show better poll numbers.
Instead, he said, they want to give more support to Republican congressional candidates.
Olympics: Brazen cheating in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's track and field athletes are facing embarrassment after a second doping scandal at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
Kenya has sent a coach home after an attempted doping test in the Olympic village.
The International Olympic Committee said it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official said the former sprinter and now coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to Kenya's team management by the doping controllers.
The world governing body, the IAAF, has asked the IOC for information on the case to launch its own investigation, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," an IAAF statement said.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and posed as Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed it," Kenya's head of mission Stephan Arap Soi said.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the World Anti-Doping Agency's training control list.
Ferguson Rotich finished fourth in the 800 metres at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing.
Four days earlier, Kenya's head of athletics delegation, Michael Rotich, had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed his country's athletes of pending doping tests in exchange for cash payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested at Nairobi airport on his return.
Kenya has long been under special scrutiny by the IOC after numerous doping violations.
Unusually, when the IOC announced more than 2,000 anti-doping controls ahead of the Rio Games, it was previously pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia were particularly targeted.
Before the Summer Games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to establish an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
As a result, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose anti-doping measures comply with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's track and field athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing.
In a series of television reports by ARD, accusations have repeatedly been made that doping funds are readily available in Kenya and that there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It has been proven that widespread and systematic doping has taken place in this sport.
Russia's track and field athletes were subsequently banned from the Summer Games.
Salzburg's "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as tragic lovers, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
Including a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: "West Side Story," Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
Artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and fulfilled a childhood dream with the role of Maria.
In the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra conducted by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers wistfully her love affair with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
Firstly, because she is musically exceptional!
And then there's Mary's personality.
As she puts it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she is smart, naive, and very passionate.
"She's very similar to me, the Italian character I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She is a tremendously generous person.
And Bartoli returned the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in his every movement, in his gaze, it is his life!
It's such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important!
For the American director Philip W. McKinley, "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This play is about prejudice and bigotry."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the people of New York did not want them.
They are the same issues, and they are as relevant today as they were then.
Fifty-nine years later, the play is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She was believed to have been killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 and died shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England, according to her family.
"One can only hope that the only good thing - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks involved in going to a war zone - is to stop people from ever making that decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane bound for Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family have been told she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within months.
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if she wins
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid is convinced that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since he was nominated by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will nominate the successor to the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday during a conference call that he expects Clinton to pick Garland "with some degree of certainty."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not yet spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not be troubled by a new candidate.
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocking Garland's nomination were lackeys and accomplices of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump is unfit to be president.
Treats wants nude calendar for "women and men"
Treats magazine has teamed up with photographer David Bellemere to release a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats editor-in-chief Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine was different from old-school Playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does.
"We need to return to the representation of timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release accompanying the calendar's release.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass exodus
"Those who do not conform and praise Erdogan are sitting on packed suitcases," says Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-affiliated Dialogue and World Foundation.
The Kurdish community in Germany is expecting tens of thousands of asylum seekers to flee Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term it could even be "a few hundred thousand," believes Ali Toprak, chairman of the association.
Due to the crackdown by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community in Germany is expecting a mass exodus to Germany.
"In the short term I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term a few hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," Ali Toprak, chairman of the association, told Die Welt on Friday.
Because the government had already imposed punitive measures on Kurdish strongholds months ago, 500,000 Kurds were on the run within Turkey.
After the foiled coup, secular and opposition ethnic Turks were added.
Many will want to start afresh in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be the case that a state that takes in refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," Toprak said.
The head of the association deplored the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevi cities.
Erdogan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds to leave.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled in the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association demanded that the German government "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters."
A "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics is also taking place in Germany.
For the first time in the last few months, I no longer feel safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition figures.
Branding Gülen supporters destroys teachers and other academics "professional livelihoods.
"Those who do not conform and praise Erdogan are sitting on packed suitcases, including Kemalists and secularists," Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-affiliated Dialogue and Education Foundation, told Die Welt.
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, even before the coup, the Turks constituted the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany.
As of June 30, this was 11,386 people, or just under 29 percent of all those recognised as entitled to asylum (39,625).
This survey does not include those who have fled war, poverty or lack of prospects.
Under the Basic Law, asylum seekers are exclusively persecuted politically, i.e. by the state, individually.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Going where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the state parliament.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
2021 the state election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it doesn't get any stupider than it used to: summer holidays, heat and state election campaigns - that bites.
The locals, who are to be persuaded by the campaigners, are on holiday.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so may not vote for the state parliament.
In addition, there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count votes are difficult to find.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has until 4 September 2016, the election day and the last day of holiday, to endure another election campaign just short of the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And there is also something at stake: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in opinion polls.
It will be interesting to see how much newcomer AfD performs and what is left in the end suitable for coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, is running an almost inconspicuous election campaign, apart from his large posters.
He travels around the country handing out roses and chatting with people, just as his legendary taciturn predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise Seelering got cold feet, blaming Chancellor Merkel for the AfD's blossoming.
Her refugee policy, her "We can do this," has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which is now likely to cost him his fine office.
The CDU, with its leading candidate, the Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to campaign in the wrong place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel's parliamentary constituency is in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania.
"There was probably a majority from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, complained recently in NDR.
But it does no harm to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the north-eastern CDU largely dispenses with the usual campaign stalls in market squares and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.
This, says Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role."
The Union, too, has noticed that its base in the countryside is crumbling away, that it has to make a great effort to reconnect with the people.
She is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly present in the vastness of the country.
The advice of the CDU election campaigner Kokert to his comrades-in-arms, however, is also self-revealing: "You have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used."
Because the stakes are high, Sellering has now called on his SPD to conduct a particularly committed election campaign.
In opinion polls, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and only just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are expected to make it into the state parliament.
They are making a modern virtue of necessity and are largely relocating their campaign online.
"Online election campaign," is what the chairwoman of the state, Claudia Müller, calls it.
Otherwise, Green campaigners are on the hunt for local voters among holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the leading candidate, is curving with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and still finds it beautiful.
Her impression: "Voting leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."
B27 redevelopment: Restaurants suffer from closure
There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being renovated.
There is praise everywhere for those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 in the morning and does not end until around 8pm.
"They made everything pretty jagged," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet gas station.
This is a super team.
There is also no delay.
At the beginning of the week, the construction site could be moved south at half-time as planned, and everything should be ready by the end of October.
It also praises the courtesy shown by those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to setting up makeshift entrances.
Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation within the town has eased.
Citizens can now drive on both sides of the B 27 from Ofterdingen.
The evasive traffic through the town seems to be decreasing.
"There were some significant complaints," says Florian King, the deputy head of the main office responsible for traffic management of the refurbishment.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to contend with more traffic noise, because many were looking for surreptitious routes and trusted their sat nav rather than the signs.
As a result, some trucks became frayed in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were also not observed, the municipality increasingly requested the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There have been significant transgressions," said King, who has seen the situation first-hand.
There have already been two to three flashes per minute.
The fastest was travelling at 77 km / h in the 30-km / h zone.
Since the construction site moved on, however, it has become quieter.
For the businessmen on the B 27 it is only a small consolation that the street is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Businessmen don't like to look at the cards.
But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to a drop in turnover for them is obvious to anyone who is asked.
However, some are more affected and some less so.
For those who have less to do with the "end customer," i.e. produce for other companies, the refurbishment has hardly any consequences.
At the Maier dealership, too, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "slight decline at most," but also acknowledges that, of course, "the running clientele is missing."
The pubs along the road are the hardest hit.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
This is already existential threat.
Not only him, but all the restaurants had been "hit hard."
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We have to be happy about every euro of turnover.
He puts the drop in sales at "well over 50 percent."
He said the road refurbishment had "set his business back two years."
He had to lay off half of his staff.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half of them had been made redundant, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, the President of the regional government, Jörg Schmidt, responded to a question from Göhner as to whether there could be financial compensation by pointing out that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27. Now it would also have to bear the disadvantages arising from the refurbishment.
Göhner knows of other counties where this has been handled more generously.
Despite all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been based here since 1715, he points to its long history.
He can understand why other regulars stop by less often now because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele will return after the refurbishment works have been completed.
Despite the BSE and avian influenza crises, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction works on his customers to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction, that's brutal.
Legislation is constantly being tweaked in the name of fighting terrorism.
Following the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does tolerance have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliator.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, says the Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package.
They don't overwhelm anyone.
Other, more far-reaching issues would first be discussed within the parties.
I take part in that, too.
But as home secretary, he said he wanted results and an "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière let a little time pass before presenting his conclusions on security in the republic.
But they are now all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, targeted: that a new security authority should take care of cracking encrypted communications is nothing new.
Nor does the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger name records and weapons law.
The call for more video surveillance and staffing for security agencies comes as no surprise.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second attempt at proposals that have so far not been possible with the SPD: he wants to criminalize sympathetic advertising for terrorist groups and strip jihadists with dual citizenship of their German passports.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," concedes the CDU man.
Nevertheless, he considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that does not stand a chance with the coalition partner anyway.
de Maizière also presents a few new ideas.
They are partly to blame: he is planning fast-track procedures for deportations and more possibilities for detaining people before they are deported.
Refugees who are specifically brought into the country should have their smartphones checked beforehand and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
When it comes to tolerating rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse off than before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of this is politically and legally sensitive.
Some things seem half-baked and leave questions unanswered.
And on some points - the unequal treatment of those who are tolerated, for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But there is no denying that the attackers in Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security given the high number of refugees.
And things that deeply preoccupied people could not be excluded even during election campaigns.
Internal security has come under enormous scrutiny.
First the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
There is a great deal of uncertainty.
And yes, there are election campaigns ahead.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly positioning themselves on the subject of internal security.
The past few days have been fraught with tension between the two parties.
First a nasty dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a collection of security policy ideas of some Union interior ministers, in which the department chiefs also call for a burqa ban and a renunciation of dual citizenship.
De Maizière is also trying to strike a conciliatory tone here.
He said he did not think there would be a move away from the double pass.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
It would not make sense to reopen them.
And he said he had constitutional concerns about a burqa ban.
Whether his own package is constitutional in all corners, and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, remains to be seen.
There is something in it that could cause controversy.
But the SPD is also currently trying to make a name for itself on the subject of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel has signalled a cautious willingness to talk, saying: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security."
Volkswagen is still getting away with it.
Despite the diesel scandal, deliveries are on the rise worldwide.
But not all markets are running smoothly.
There is a fuss over a term in the recall.
Volkswagen starts the second half of the year with a more subdued start to deliveries.
Despite the diesel affair, Europe's largest carmaker has continued to show a plus in the course of the year thanks to its many brands and some well-performing markets.
However, the core VW brand weakened in July, particularly in Western Europe, again weighing on overall sales, according to the Dax-listed company.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 449100 cars in July, 1.8 percent fewer than in the same month last year.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent below the same month last year.
In its home market of Germany, deliveries fell by almost a sixth.
Head of Brand Sales Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July mainly to two fewer sales days in Europe.
In addition, there was a reluctance to buy in some core markets due to "changed economic conditions."
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU has also weighed on the situation, a spokeswoman said.
In the USA, where the exhaust fumes affair first escalated, there is also a further decline.
The Chinese market is a major prop for VW.
All in all, the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony continues to suffer slightly from the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, deliveries are down by only 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles.
Group Sales Director Fred Kappler continued to show an increase in sales from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during this period, 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had used software to manipulate emissions tests.
In Germany alone, VW is calling around 2.5 million cars to the workshops for retrofitting.
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
After the conversion of the vehicles there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The carmaker issued customers with a "guarantee-like" certificate after the conversion, but did not mention a "guarantee," as it said in company circles on Friday.
The reason is legal niceties.
Focus had reported that Volkswagen was now offering its German customers a guarantee for retrofitted diesel models.
This was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that the meeting took place.
"VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA."
"Deviations from this will not be accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the ministry.
VW has given a guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance will not deteriorate after the conversion and that all vehicle values relevant to type approval will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself, however, does not use the term "warranty," as it has been called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "warranty," Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, come to a workshop six months after the conversion with an engine failure - and could attribute this to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the interests of the customer to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal and to avoid uncertainty as to possible warranty arrangements, it was said.
That is why VW does not use the term "warranty."
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee is the second bank in Germany to demand punitive interest rates from wealthy savers.
Bank chief executive Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's just about 139 customers parking 40 million euros in current or overnight accounts."
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers would "not have to fear to pay punitive interest on their savings pennies."
If banks deposit money overnight with the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay its 0.4 percent penalty rate.
From September, Raiffeisenbank Gmund will demand this fee back from private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros in current or overnight money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year," Paul said.
For some time now, he has been guarding EUR 40 million, which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he could not exploit.
"They are in my bank account and cost 0.4 per cent," he said.
'I can't put a price on every million. '
He is now passing on the costs according to the polluter pays principle.
Simply leaving the cash in the vaults of the Raiffeisen bank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four robberies, I don't want the fifth!," said the bank executive.
Most customers would understand and switch to other forms of investment.
Few migrated to other banks.
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria said: "The extreme monetary policy stance of the ECB is causing considerable costs for all banks."
Wearing them alone is "not economically feasible in the long term."
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
The Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land and its Skatbank branch made headlines in 2014 with punitive interest rates for deposits of three million euros or more.
Michael Kemmer, Managing Director of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect retail customers to have to pay fees for deposits across the board. Competition among banks and savings banks in Germany is far too strong for this."
One banker said there was "a clientele at the Tegernsee that is a little richer in assets."
"This can be a problem for a small bank" if it keeps money for free.
The Gmund Cooperative Bank, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria "is currently not aware of any other banks that charge reimbursement for deposits by private customers," said spokesman Ernst.
Uwe Fröhlich, President of the Bundesverband der deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), declared at the end of June: "The threshold for going negative towards private customers is very, very high."
Competition is fierce and there is a risk of an exodus of investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not put up with this in broad terms.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love records.
Before rushing to the comment section to litter it with crude insults under the pseudonym NonAllAllAllAllMiddle-Aged Men, this statement is derived from actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-talked-about resurgence of records is not down to a boom in millennials embracing the novelty of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a record are likely to be aged between 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the least likely buyer group.
Nor is it hoarding by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results from YouGov correct?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk down a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and gesturing wildly before stopping, holding my hands and saying something startling like: "So, let's take a closer look."
So, let's take a look.
Although the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings that once housed independent sellers - there are still a handful of fantastic record shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mood by observation.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, who I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her 20s), is in London for a day for a meeting and goes around the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he emailed me the snapshot, I didn't follow him home), line the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they were released and to buy again items that he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of the things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that came out when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably a little too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records tend to be introverted and enjoy spending time alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my vice.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media frenzy, people who have heard about the comeback and feel compelled to buy their old records again.
From the conversations I had, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.
That would explain the boom in record revivalists of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took offence at the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retire to the stability of familiar record sleeves, items that evoke happy childhood memories.
"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material possessions as a kind of comfort," Wez says.
This is the case for me as a collector and I think it is the case for a lot of people.
It's an easy way to engage mentally.
"We're like their social workers!" whispers a member of staff from a stack of records.
An ICM poll in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month had not listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very concerned as I scroll through a stack of bossa nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone came in here the other day and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf, "" he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-driven, less music-driven.
We have people saying, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people, who are coming in slowly.
Fopp, which has devoted almost an entire floor to the records, has a more colourful audience when I enter.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz booms out of the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around the store for several minutes looking at the variety of records for sale.
She does more window shopping than bulk shopping.
She doesn't earn much, so collecting records isn't a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to listen to music from a computer or some other way, but the beauty of records is... "she drifts off with a smitten sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a store said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While pretending to model the denim hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls cluster around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and daughter consider buying a Crosley turntable.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so high up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "record art."
But given that any attraction to these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there's nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a demographic that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as records.
Although my research has shown that YouGov's findings are correct, they do not take into account, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality, record shops and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings browsing Berwick Street record shops and flicking through records, avoiding the staring gaze of an eerie 30-year-old fake presenter towering over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the record was set by a female believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five metres long
French court rejects bid to demolish Jungle refugee camp shops
A French court has rejected an offer by authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Calais Jungle, home to thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should have the authority to demolish 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they would be a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which posed a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also said the makeshift shops and restaurants would often provide shelter and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people running the 72 temporary shops, but acknowledged that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were "perfectly understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the areas provide quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids' Café, which is a non-profit offering 200 meals a day, English and French classes and advice on asylum issues for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
A letter to the Guardian said the closure "would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom is eight years old."
The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the Jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a surge in new arrivals over the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment, Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympic time trial, professional cyclist Tony Martin is determined not to be beaten.
"I keep my eye on the World Cup, stay confident and keep fighting," the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable 12th place finish at Sugarloaf.
"I honestly find it hard to comment on yesterday's time trial," Martin said.
He needs to calmly analyse what led to the debacle.
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the World Time Trial Championships in Qatar in October.
'I'm going to look at everything that we've changed in recent times. '
"That includes my position," wrote the three-time time time trial world champion, who lost more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) in the 54.5 km race on Wednesday.
Olympics: Tennis pro Siegemund misses semi-final
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarter-finals of Rio: The world ranking 32nd from Metzingen missed by a 1: 6, 1: 6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico / WTA No.
34) the semifinals of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Siegemund, who has been plagued by back problems, could only hold her serve once and looked powerless compared to previous rounds.
On Thursday, medal hope Angelique Kerber (No.
The Australian Open winner will face Britain's Johanna Konta (No 10).
Tommy Haas was the last German professional tennis player to win a silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
The last time there were two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of the Summer Games was in 1992.
Never before has a German duo reached an Olympic singles semi-final.
Group joins start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend - and Microsoft wants to benefit from it.
The technology group is buying the start-up Beam, which specialises in this hobby.
Microsoft did not disclose on Thursday how much money is being spent on the acquisition.
Beam only launched its service in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give players missions and confront enemies, as well as provide equipment.
Gaming giant Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
Facebook is supposed to help on the way to a global media event.
The advertising industry is already paying attention.
Employees of the start-up, which is currently based in Seattle, Washington state, are moving to Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, California, according to Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi.
The takeover is not expected to change anything for customers.
Beam will be integrated into the video games division around the Xbox console, according to Microsoft.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is owned by Google parent Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's speedometers have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: In various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new speed cameras are being tested that are intended to transfer speedometers particularly effectively.
The futuristic-looking Enforcement Trailers from the Wiesbaden-based company Vitronic can be used, for example, in accident areas where it would be too dangerous for the police to carry out mobile measurements.
For example, at motorway construction sites or bridges to be renovated with a temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary speed camera.
However, a permanent mobile setup can be too dangerous or costly.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days with uninterrupted measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
Laser measurement technology also enables all vehicles to be recorded simultaneously across several lanes.
Variable speed limits and traffic bans by time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.
According to the manufacturer, the trailer can be moved in the raised state with any car with a trailer hitch.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels disappear in the armoured and by the way also bulletproof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is to protect the speed camera from vandalism.
According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states since 2015 and is now also in use.
Foreign authorities are also flashing the new technology: France recently ordered 100 units, following an order of 150 last year.
Great Britain take silver in men's rugby sevens after Fiji win gold
Great Britain's impressive performance in the Rugby Sevens final came to an abrupt halt at the final hurdle on Thursday night as the Fijians were beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, side-stepping, back-tracking, line-running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.
The defeat was sweetened by the not-too-bad consolation prize of a silver medal - Great Britain's fourth on the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The Boks' emphatic 7-5 defeat in the semi-final on the same day could come back to haunt them in the final.
But regardless, on this form Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team at their best.
It might be some consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.
GB have had a difficult road.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
This defeat will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started beautifully and let their attacks bounce back for fun.
It felt like running into moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and Co. and the World Series winners went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau flicked over in the corner.
With four minutes left, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A superb tackle by Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored a touchdown in the right corner to make it 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added another after the restart and there was still more than a minute of play... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou raced through another weak tackle by Team GB and stormed to the line to score.
The conversion made it 29-0 at the break.
It's as if Fiji were born to play the No 7 while GB are still learning.
So it is.
GB made fundamental changes at half-time and closed the Fijian gap... for a full four minutes, which was good by first-half standards, until Joshua Tuisova crossed after a brilliant interplay by Fiji.
Dan Norton kicked a try for GB, scoring a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7 lead, but the game was long gone in favour of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It wasn't hard to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the dying seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis embraced and GB kicked crushingly into the turf.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in the semi-final and Great Britain edged out South Africa in a tight semi-final match - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton broke through the line with impressive footwork and scored under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the England 15-man team, secured the win - and the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach's cancer battle
There will be no more emotinal gold than at these Games and that means something.
From the first rowing stroke to the last, 220 hard blows that will go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found extra meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even if it was just the two of them at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams was omnipresent as they rowed to their second consecutive Olympic gold in the coxless pairs, the first women in the history of British sport to set such a benchmark.
Their dominance was absolute, their 39th unbeaten effort, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make the difference, and there was no one more helpful than the coach who, 30 months ago, did not know if he would even survive that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don't, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate that he was able to begin treatment in early 2014, off-season, which kept the disruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walking around the ward - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediate aftermath of the victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual and trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who served in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment, said: 'I've been an emotional wreck this week, which may be a bit extreme, but it means so much.'
It just repeats how much it means to me, how much me and Helen and Robin have worked.
It's been a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thank you goes to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better person to coach or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm that their opponents could not keep up with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark were starting to catch up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught up in the moment.
Helen shouted "stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything great.
We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year off before making any decisions about their future.
Glover is due to appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took me about six months to realise I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better, 'she said.
Exemplary clarity for 31 years
Ruppert Göller, Managing Director of the Veitenstein Group, is retiring.
The association is regarded as "exemplary throughout Bavaria."
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
This is what was said some time ago in the original tone in an article by Bayerischer Rundfunk.
Shortly afterwards, the Water Forum of the Lower Franconia government paid tribute to the Zweckverband.
The work of the Veitenstein Group is considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria."
Behind all this stands Rupert Göller, who was an employee of the Zweckverband for 31 years, including 28 years as managing director.
He has now retired at the age of 65.
The Drinking Water Association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, pumps about 150,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with about 5,500 inhabitants.
The member municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
Water supply contracts are in place for other towns and municipalities.
The current chairwoman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water warden in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband in 1988.
"His duties have been very varied, ranging from water pipe construction and maintenance to office and organizational work, budget planning, fee and contribution calculation, and emergency operations at weekends," she said.
Among the outstanding events she mentioned were the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the rehabilitation of the elevated tanks (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
There had been no standstill and innovations had been introduced time and again, because water meant life and drinking water was the most important food.
In her eulogy she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has put his heart and soul into his Water Purpose Association and he has literally lived the Water Purpose Association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the successful concept of the Veitenstein Group for reducing nitrates in front of the Water Forum of the Lower Franconia district.
He received a lot of recognition and praise for that.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised water warden Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best water warden and he was a loyal squire.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he described the well construction and the restructuring of the association as highlights.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult operation, however, was the rupture of the pipe at the elevated tank near Kirchlauter on 3 January.
Here we had to work all night at minus 17 degrees so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Even the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once, because the elevated tank was filled with hoses from Pettstadt.
The management of the Drinking Water Association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko is open about her son Tiago's autism - and addresses other concerned parents: "You need to have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," the 44-year-old told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When her son was diagnosed with the disease, she believed she was going to die.
But eight-year-old Tiago has made good progress and is now learning privately in New York, where the best therapists are available.
"To give an example, when I ask him something that happened two years ago when I was singing at La Scala in Milan, he doesn't remember anything," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with bass-baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship crime in Bargteheide - Man shoots partner
A 35-year-old man shot and fatally wounded his partner in an apartment building in Bargteheide (Stormarn district) at around 10.45am on Friday.
"The man himself called us and said he had shot his partner," a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator is on the run, and a public search is under way for him.
Meanwhile nationwide, because Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, tanned and has a bald head.
Police have since released a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man is bald.
The man should not be approached directly.
He was still able to carry the weapon, police said.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call 110.
Police are calling it a "relationship crime."
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck initially did not want to give any information on the course of the crime or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim; however, they confirmed that one person had been killed.
'It's a homicide. '
"We are not saying any more at this time," a police spokeswoman said.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - bright spot for the German steel industry
The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared millions in additional costs.
Financial burdens, which threatened the industry from the green electricity promotion, are off the table.
The exemption from the renewable energy surcharge for existing plants for so-called self-generated electricity production in the German steel industry remains in place, Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) told the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really pleased that after two years of tough negotiations we have finally been able to achieve this."
The European Commission had initially planned to charge steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry was threatened with additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there was now an agreement in principle with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators in the steel mills are replaced will there be an EEG levy of 20 percent.
But even this is not levied in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on self-generated electricity.
This would largely establish the status quo of the previous regime.
Gabriel's successful efforts are of particular importance for the steel industry.
"This is a first step in our 'Steel is the Future' campaign."
'There's more to come. '
"Climate and employment targets must also be weighed when reforming emissions trading," IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann said in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
The situation worsened further last year when China, the world's largest producer, dumped steel en masse on the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has eased somewhat.
On the one hand, import tariffs imposed on imported steel are having an effect, and on the other, the economic outlook in China has brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Most recently, prices have stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to rule out closing individual plants.
The German steel industry employed around 86,000 people at the end of 2015.
Despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steelmakers remained cautious in July.
At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the same month last year, the German Steel Association announced on Friday.
After a brief increase in May, the amount produced fell for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production is two percent below the previous year's level.
Thanks to an improved order situation, the association expects output to increase in the coming months.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing is good for seniors
Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she studied music as a teacher, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she says.
After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, happy and overall more alive, she says.
Along the way, she is doing something good for her health and her mind.
Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in a choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, Hackler describes.
By being together regularly, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp also experienced this in her choir: "To coordinate and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.
This is because seniors train deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of breath so quickly, even in everyday life.
Even when it comes to preserving the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Association of Senior Citizens "Organisations.
In the older generations singing together was much more important, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs awakens many memories in older people, often connected with positive feelings of their youth.
Through song lyrics and especially melodies, even people suffering from dementia remember long-ago events.
When singing, the head is also required to perform in a special way, explains Lenz.
Concentrating on one's own voice and on a given rhythm at the same time and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Older people, in particular, who live alone, practice not just concentrating on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you get from singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.
Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
To show oneself: If I practice for a long time, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
So there are plenty of good reasons to start singing.
If you want to try out a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, advises Lenz.
You don't sing alone - with 50 people singing, who hears when a note goes wrong?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from your circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can simply join in.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the congregation or the church rector directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbors for help with Internet searches.
Those who want to sing should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.
Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - this applies to all ages.
Cats are more sensitive than males to the cries of kittens
Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the meowing did not leave the males cold either - however, in contrast to the females, they always behaved the same.
Female cats can recognize the level of arousal of kittens by the meowing of the kittens.
They react ten per cent faster to sounds from kittens who think they are in great distress, as scientists from the University of Veterinary Medicine and the Hannover Medical School (MHH) have discovered.
Hangovers also react to the calls of kittens - but always in the same way.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between the meowing of less and highly excited juveniles are either imperceptible or irrelevant to the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding from MHH.
She is the lead author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology.
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of kitten cries varied with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult males and eight females from MHH animal husbandry were observed.
On the one hand, they were played calls from little ones, who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more agitated kittens, which were also lifted up.
Despite the small sample size, the researchers believe their results are significant.
"All the females, even those that didn't have offspring of their own, reacted differently to the screams," Konerding said.
They turned to the loudspeaker faster when it played the calls of the more excited kittens.
This ability may be innate or develop with sexual maturity.
"One surprise was that the males reacted at all," the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have repeatedly studied the reactions of men and women to baby sounds in humans.
Some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to infants, regardless of whether they were already mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski grabs Supercup with 'Gala'
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
An arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey for former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time since the coup attempt, an important football match is taking place in Turkey.
Ahead of the clash between arch rivals Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul for the Konya Supercup, the official line is clear: "Business as usual."
Even when the state of emergency was declared after the coup attempt in July, the government asserted that the daily lives of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed for the coup attempt.
And it doesn't stop at football.
Prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for former star kicker Hakan Sükür.
The South Korean, who now lives in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency, initially imposed for 90 days, is still in force until October, it has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks.
Erdogan declared an end to nightly "democracy guards" in public squares across the country on Wednesday.
Sport, like the whole country, is divided between supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Fans of working-class club Besiktas, in particular, are traditionally not among the president's friends.
What unites the majority of Turks, however, in the face of dramatic historical experiences, is the firm rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - whether their hearts are beating for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
Lukas Podolski will be particularly important for the Cup winners Gala.
The 31-year-old from Cologne proved his sporting value last season: with 17 goals and nine assists in all competitions, he finished his first season as his club's top scorer.
He scored the winning goal in the final against Fenerbahce.
The Fanatik newspaper hailed him: "He was the best on the pitch."
He has finished the season in an outstanding way and secured the trophy for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi," the disappointing season for the record champion came to a conciliatory end.
After the knockout stages of the Champions League, the "Lions" were eliminated early in the Europa League.
In the Süper Lig it was only enough to rank sixth.
The season hasn't been good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
"We did that and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.
The season went better for champions Besiktas.
Particularly thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the foundations for a 14th title with 26 goals of the season as the top scorer in the Premier League.
That is why fans continue to hope for the 31-year-old's return.
Gomez, who is under contract with AC Florence and only on loan to Besiktas, had announced after the coup attempt that he would not return after his European Championship holiday due to the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," Kicker magazine quoted club boss Fikret Orman as saying.
To do so, however, the striker would have to be willing to forgo around a third of his annual salary, estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman clarified: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence."
Despite doping, these athletes still have a medal chance at the Rio Olympics
Justin Gatlin, 34, has twice been banned for doping, in 2001 and 2006.
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanova is banned from competing in Rio.
Other convicted track and field sinners can only laugh at this - they are fighting for medals in Rio.
Doping continues to dominate the headlines at the Rio Olympics.
The Russian swimmer Yulia Yefimova, who had claimed her right to compete shortly before the Games after a doping ban, was mercilessly booed and booed at her start (100 metres breaststroke).
It was a bizarre scene: She had strutted into the hall with a put-on smile and had provoked with her performance.
When it was clear she wasn't going to win gold, the crowd erupted in cheers.
But there are plenty of other athletes competing at the Rio Olympics despite their doping past.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100m relay / USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He has already been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his spell, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion has run even faster than before, winning the 100m in 9.80 seconds and being considered Usain Bolt's greatest challenger.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m relay / Jamaica): The two-time Olympic and seven-time world champion served a six-month suspension in 2010 after she was found to have taken the painkiller oxycodone.
The 29-year-old defended herself after suffering severe toothache following surgery.
Sandra Perkovic (discus / Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic champion, 2013 World Champion and 2010-2016 European Champion tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied knowingly taking the drug and was banned for six months.
The four furthest throws this year go to the big favourite for gold.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400m relay / USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world 400m champion tested positive in 2010 and was banned for 21 months.
A penis enlargement drug was responsible, Merritt said.
This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world over 200m and 400m.
Ivan Tikhon (hammer throw, Belarus): Hardly any athlete has been stripped of so many medals.
Tikhon lost his 2005 world title nine years later after being diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver in 2004 for steroid doping and the European Championship title in 2006 for testosterone abuse.
He was also stripped of his 2008 Olympic bronze medal following a ruling by the International Court of Sport (CAS).
With 80.04 m he is in second place in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20km walk, China): The world record holder and gold favourite only tested positive in May, but is still allowed to compete in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion was found to have taken a banned dietary supplement and the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) suspension was lenient, expiring on July 13.
Bomb Terror in Thailand - Austrian Woman Injured - Several Dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll said Friday morning.
She had suffered cuts and was being treated in hospital, but had already been able to leave.
She had planned to return home at the beginning of September.
It is still unclear whether Austrian citizens are also affected by the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon.
The State Department is in constant contact with local authorities in this regard, Schnöll said.
In Hua Hin, some 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs exploded in a nightlife district on Thursday evening.
According to police, one Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
Two more IEDs went off Friday morning, killing another person, according to authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket in the morning.
A taxi driver was injured in the explosion near Patong beach, which is popular with holidaymakers, according to police.
Then, in Surat Thani on the country's southeast coast, another bomb exploded, killing a city employee.
The explosive device blew up in a flower bed outside the coastal police station, according to authorities.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and in Chumphon on the southeast coast left several injured.
It is believed to be linked to the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
"The bombings bear the same signature," Army Gen. Danai Kritchavee told reporters Friday morning.
'We're assuming it was a coordinated attack. '
He said it was too early to comment on possible motives - but it was likely the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also sought to identify a pattern in the attacks that is typical of bombings by Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
Thai police, however, said the attacks were not linked to the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism.
"This is just local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," a spokesman in Bangkok said.
Rather, it is believed that the bombs were planted by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities had received intelligence indicating imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and locations.
It was not yet clear which group was behind the attacks.
Police have instructed officers across the country to step up security around key government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand there are always smaller bombings, but they are usually not directed against tourists.
Hua Hin is home to a palace that was used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities absolutely.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, unnecessary travel to these provinces is discouraged.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday came just days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This gives the military great influence in the years to come.
Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to sow chaos as the country moves toward stability, an improvement in the economy and tourism.
The military junta, which seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, credits itself with restoring stability and order to the kingdom.
But the military has also failed to contain the Muslim insurgency that has simmered for years in the country's far south.
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Less than a year ago, an attack at a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok also killed 20 people, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.
The right-wing "Identitäre Bewegung" (Identitarian Movement) has been targeted by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
After several state offices, the constitutional protectors in the federal government have also placed the group under observation.
"We see in the 'Identitarian Movement' indications of efforts against the liberal democratic basic order," Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of constitutional protection, told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Berlin.
Immigrants of the Islamic faith or from the Middle East are vilified in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitäre Bewegung" (Identitarian Movement) is a group with French roots that has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes "multicultural delusion," "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's identity through alienation."
Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identitarians."
Maaßen said his agency had coordinated closely with the provincial authorities in making the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' are trying to get their target audience where they are," he said.
In general, extremists try to address them with youth-oriented language, often with pop music.
Islamists as well as right-wing extremists would do that.
This is not a cosy advertisement for one's own cause.
The propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
This is dangerous.
Recently there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "Identitären" to AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of that.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant after a certain point.
It depends on whether the party in question - in this case the AfD - changes its direction and becomes extremist through certain individuals who are extremist.
What matters, then, is whether such people have a controlling influence on the party.
This was not apparent.
With regard to the significant increase in right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have seen in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Gruppe.
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or micro-groups are forming that are planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks for other right-wing extremist motives.
A Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of right-wing terrorism is not recognizable, however.
The previous groups had arisen at the regional level or in social networks.
Maaßen expressed concern that many of the attacks were carried out by people who had not previously appeared in the right-wing scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or right-wing supporters.
"So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing at all to do with right-wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent or voted for example CDU, SPD or Linke, but who then became radicalised by right-wing extremist propaganda."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an internet hit
Olympians or world records do not always dominate the headlines at the Olympics.
This is shown by the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he could not be seen in the TV pictures.
He just disappeared - no matter how wide the cut was.
Habte subsequently became a viral internet hit on social media.
In fact, the 24-year-old finishes 48 seconds behind and is 59th out of 59 starters.
But it was rather his less-than-athletic figure that caught the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still competing in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian was granted special entry rights by the International Swimming Federation.
This is distributed to promote swimming in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte gets ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the rounds.
Some media referred to him as "Robel the Whale."
The English tabloid "The Sun" mocked him with "Dad Bod" in reference to a "wealth belly."
His time of one minute and almost five seconds in the 100m freestyle didn't matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" have also been drawn.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run attracted media attention.
The performance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable, when he had to compete alone in a preliminary round of the 100-meter freestyle.
Moussambani was cheered wildly at the time.
The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop on Neuer Platz has been robbed.
According to police, the 67-year-old woman had left her shop at around 5.30pm on Monday, forgetting to close a downstairs window.
When she returned at around 8.15am the next morning, about 250 euros had disappeared from the cash register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump doesn't see looming election defeat as close
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If the US presidential election is anything to go by, Donald Trump already has an alternative.
He's just going on holiday.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, he would not care: "Ultimately, it will either work out, or I will have a very, very nice, long vacation," the Republican nominee said in a telephone interview with US television network CNBC.
If it's not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, Trump said.
He described US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as the founders of the Islamic State terrorist group (IS).
Resistance has been building within his party lately.
Post Office enters the trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great.
The Post Office also plans to sell its StreetScooter electric vehicle.
The company plans to start trading the van shortly.
From next year, the Post Office will also be offering its electric vans on the independent car market.
"We want to get into selling to third parties," a Post spokesman said on Friday.
The company has been considering for months whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, which delivers letters and parcels, to other companies.
Post board member Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always inquiries, for example from craftsmen.
According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel," the Bonn-based company plans to enter mass production of the vehicles shortly.
The company plans to build up to 10,000 cars a year per shift at its post-production facility.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly expand its fleet of electric cars and was aiming for a complete conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We're going to take a very, very robust step toward 2020," he had said in late July.
I can imagine that we will convert the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
GfK management resigns after disappointing business figures
Consumer research company GfK is replacing its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations were sudden - but not entirely surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the longer the promised successes fail to materialise, the more uncertain CEO Matthias Hartmann's chair will become.
Turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg-based market research company GfK: After yet another disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company's management, the world's number five in the industry is facing a new start in terms of personnel.
The CEO of GfK wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, is leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The company announced that Gerhard Hausruckinger, a former member of the Management Board, will take over the leadership of the Management Board as of September 1.
He is to officially assume the function of "CEO" until a successor for Hartmann has been found.
The company cited "differing views" on the long-term direction of its business as the reason for the resignations.
A company spokesman declined to give details on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
In investor circles, it was said on Friday that shareholders had recently been very disappointed with the lack of success of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the helm of GfK since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible even after five years," it said.
In view of the recent poor GfK business figures, every shareholder will become restless at some point.
"If that were the case at BMW, the Quandts would do the same," it said.
After setbacks in previous quarters, the company was unable to halt its loss drive in the second quarter of 2016.
At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent lower than in the comparable quarter of the previous year.
Regarding the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent to 721.2 million euros.
Profit in the second quarter was mainly impacted by the company's lower value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The impairment of goodwill of 139 million euros, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience division, resulted in a net loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips into ditch in Krummhörn: Eight injured
Eight people were injured in an accident involving a coach carrying 43 senior citizens in Krummhörn (district of Aurich) on Thursday.
Two of the occupants suffered serious injuries, police said.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid an oncoming truck, which partially drove on the oncoming lane, according to her information.
The bus veered off the road to the right and slid into a ditch, a police spokeswoman said.
"Due to the location of the bus, people were unable to leave the bus on their own," she said.
Firefighters freed the occupants.
Six ambulances and an ambulance arrived at the scene of the accident on Highway 2.
The uninjured passengers were taken back to the Krummhorn district of Pewsum by a regular bus.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
Investigators urged the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to police.
From 1 October 2016, the fees per cubic metre of wastewater for the Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl wastewater treatment plant will be 3.44 euros instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater charge will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
According to a rough calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, it was determined with the approval of the budget by the district administration Kulmbach that undercoverings accumulate for these wastewater plants.
The Kasendorf market is legally obliged to operate the plants to cover costs.
From 1 October 2016, citizens as well as commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into their pockets.
Fee increases range from 48 percent to 67 percent.
As head of administration Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee, a recalculation of the fees for the sewage plants of the market municipality was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercoverings from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
Schmidt justified the serious fee increases with the fact that all three wastewater plants are relatively small facilities with a very low wastewater accumulation, which lies between 6800 and 12,000 cubic meters per year.
Due to the small distribution base, for example, expenditure for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the volume of wastewater in all three plants declined slightly.
Furthermore, in the previous calculation period, renovation and repair expenses were incurred to a considerable extent for all three plants, not least due to their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system in the Azendorf wastewater treatment plant had to be replaced due to damage.
In the Welschenkahl pumping station, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be completely overhauled, and at the Lopp pond sewage treatment plant, after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be dredged, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation system installed in order to be able to comply with the water regulations in the future.
Schmidt: "In addition to these extraordinary expenses were the advanced support and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 were still significantly below the current level.
Steinhäuser made it clear that with the low waste water accumulation in the three plants, the expenditure for operation and maintenance is "fully absorbed."
Schmidt added that the market community had been spared large maintenance costs for the wastewater plants over the past 20 years.
In the opinion of Steinhäuser, the situation for the aforementioned plants will remain precarious in the long term, especially as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater association cannot be extended by these plants because they are deficit facilities.
Bulgaria Reports Inflation for First Time in 8 Months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July on a monthly basis.
This is the highest level (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was recorded.
Average annual inflation over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% as measured by CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared with June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Inflation since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared with December 2015) was -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 compared with July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, compared with the previous month, the following groups of consumer goods saw price increases: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; and education.
Snapchat 'anime' effect criticised as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says the filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to race.
With its filtering tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that borders on the absurd.
They can transform into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blunt, feature-twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies a day.
All missteps are made public.
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, accusing the app of promoting blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it proposed a filter to some users this week that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage were widely shared on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was meant as a homage to anime characters, not a caricature of Asians.
But to outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded them of hurtful stereotypes.
Others emphatically rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, wrote that the filter was "hurtful and unpleasant to say the least."
She added that "it's hard to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been pulled to the pejorative extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural stumbling blocks.
American culture seems to be engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older counterparts when it comes to race - may be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it's much harder for things like this to go unnoticed than it used to," Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they don't have diverse representation of people of different skin colors in their workforce so that they can make those decisions," said Zhu, a Chinese-American, "or they have people of different skin colors who work there but aren't in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak out against it."
Others share her opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and refers to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but a spokesman said the company recently hired a human resources manager to focus on underrepresented communities and internal integration efforts.
For her part, Zhu said she will keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that's not OK."
Military leaders falsified ISIS intelligence, congressional committee finds
Military officials at the United States Central Command altered intelligence to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a congressional committee of inquiry said in a report Thursday.
The preliminary report, compiled by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee, and the Defense Budget Committee, reports deep dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of America's efforts to fight the Islamic State.
Central Command, or Cencom for short, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence information typically nodded off by senior Centcom commanders regularly painted a more positive picture of America's counter-terrorism efforts than actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, and was consistently more positive than analyses by other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article quoted the report as saying.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analysis is presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership failures at Centcom reach all the way to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report details persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
While there is no direct evidence that Obama administration officials have given instructions to alter the reports, it shows how analysts have faced pressure from their superiors to paint a more optimistic picture of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements to Congress were significantly more positive than the facts suggest," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom official publicly announced that a military recapture of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"After months of investigation, this much is clear," Mike Pompeo, a Republican congressman from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command leaders altered intelligence reports to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created the task force after it was leaked that analysts were worried about manipulating reports on Islamic State.
The report, released on Thursday, will be supplemented by more detailed findings as the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigations into the Centcom reports by the Department of Defense's inspector general are ongoing.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the committee's top Democrat, House member Adam B. Schiff, said in a statement.
That process, Mr. Schiff said, "delayed the release of intelligence reports," damaged morale among analysts and "left excessively little room for dissent."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they had found no evidence of White House interference with Centcom analysts regarding a "particular political opinion."
The preliminary findings of the congressional investigation were published Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general, which was launched after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on congressional reports while the inspector general's investigation was ongoing.
But he also noted that "experts sometimes have very divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important national defense issues."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of a successful American-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim now being made by a growing number of Defense Department officials).
But last year's allegations have raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism of classified information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of discord more than a decade ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then-George W. Bush administration, against the advice of many analysts, envisaged only a small occupation force in Iraq and spent little time worrying about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, according to government officials, Mr. Hooker's team found that, contrary to what the government said, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries would not have a significant impact on the terrorist group's financial position, as they had set up makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market.
That finding, however, was not made public, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then-commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a Senate hearing.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
USA win fourth match in women's field hockey, with showdown with Great Britain looming
A day after scoring three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team in a match Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games was supposed to be a memorable performance, but Bam, 27, said she couldn't remember ever doing that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those people who remembers their goals.
But she knows this: the Americans are 4-0 in Olympic competition and are level in their group with the British, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 win over Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will decide which of the six teams in their group will take first and second place respectively.
The first place finisher will stay out of the way of the strong Dutch women, who lead the other group.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday's match, the American women's success story has created a surprising buzz, four years after they finished last of 12 at the last London Games.
Bam was part of that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, holding a hockey stick for the first time at the age of three (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), and at the age of 16 she became a USA national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she failed to qualify for the squad.
Then came 2012, when it all went wrong for her and her team.
The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team and things began to change for the better.
"A culture change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.
We have completely turned the tide.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand strike from close range.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough, holding the score to 1-0 into the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She sprinted with the flat ball down the left flank, then moved into the middle and flicked the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal midway through the final quarter.
The shutout was the first of the tournament for USA goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had scored one goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good position," Parnham said, but how well will depend on the outcome of Saturday's next game.
Amid the frenzy of the Olympics, the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, however late it is, it is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a frantic relay race between competition and aspiration.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a burning stick, passed from crossbowman to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the Michael Phelps vs. Chad le Clos fight.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, attending the Olympics for the first time and a swarm of women with dimples, could well have been among those household names being broadcast in prime time, built up by sponsors and feel-good TV commercials, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in Olympic trampoline gymnastics.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event in the same way.
Further from the centre, partly in the shade, there are sports that are not generally recognised: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breaststroke and long may it reign.
But if I may modestly make the case for my particular favourite, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been so sparsely attended for the last 16 years that many of those I interviewed did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
It could also be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will defend their gold medals from London this year.
Trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because, to the unenlightened ear, it sounds more appropriate for a clown school than for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earthbound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoonish tremor of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it essentially unites.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means "springboard."
Aspiring winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost 30 feet into the air and have to perform a series of falling movements (twists, pike and somersaults) before landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated according to execution, difficulty and "flight time."
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medal hopefuls need to go further, faster, up and over in their pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down the playground.
They chase not only the finish line or the exit wall, but also another mocking target on television: the world or the Olympic record.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to move even a spectator to tears.
But it's also what I find a little tiring, even watching these games.
The trampoline offers a reprieve.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then up again effortlessly.
Here, too, there is competition, not without difficulty, of course, but during the exercise there is no frantic attack on the target, no vaulting into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.
It's as Zen as competing in the Olympics can be.
The women's qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 1pm Eastern Time; the men's on Saturday, also at 1pm.
NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block on both days starting at 2 p.m.
Amid the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.
If raising awareness can only be achieved by gasping and objectifying male athletes - as the male US gymnasts recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his new fan base to be gasping for air.
"A Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, Long a U.S. Ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have met with violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters were killed in exchanges of gunfire during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
For the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have rocked the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people took to the streets demanding fundamental political change.
The government's response has been ruthless, according to human rights groups.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Videos circulating of the protests, believed to be from last year or early this year, show security guards beating young people with sticks as they were forced to do a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN human rights agency is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to hold this country together, and it will be even harder in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project manager for the International Crisis Group, a research group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is valued by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
While Ethiopia has been anything but a model of democracy - human rights organizations have consistently cited government repression - the country's opposition has been curtailed, effectively silencing dissidents.
Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and they have no other options but to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
All the youth are protesting.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to the stranglehold on power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies won the opposition's last seat and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle over the jagged, disputed line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could take advantage of the turmoil and rearm.
Several factors explain why, after years of simmering beneath the surface, feelings of bitterness are now exploding.
The first seems innocuous: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones became more common and Internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does periodically, especially during protests, many people can still communicate through Internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered for protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For eons, the Amharas, who hail from Ethopia's predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economics while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.
But that, too, is changing.
"We are coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6% of the population and dominates the military, intelligence, commerce, and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at spotting early signs of discontent and using special envoys to edit opponents and neutralize them.
"The current regime lacks that basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to replace Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, when thousands protested against elections that analysts said appeared to have been botched by the government and then stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, though fewer than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But it appears that this has not prevented the Ethiopian government's internal resentment from intensifying.
And it is taking on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked Tigray-run shops in Gondar, an Amharic city, and hatred of the Tigray is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in a peculiar position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.
"This," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very fine line."
Donald Trump says his claim Obama founded ISIS was' sarcasm'
Donald J. Trump sought on Friday to dispel the latest controversy surrounding his campaign by saying that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terror group was not serious.
That clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's communication skills, whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligibly with the American public.
It also puts his comrades-in-arms, who strive to protect him during an eventful period, in the peculiar position of having to explain statements he might not have meant.
After making the suggestion at a campaign event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump rowed back on the claim on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he had no intention of suggesting that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply being sarcastic.
The tweet was in contrast to the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the allegation entirely seriously.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump soften the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know.
The latest storm of criticism is pouring down on Mr. Trump as he has tried to shift the focus of his campaign to the economy because of falling poll numbers.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to the issue.
Taking to Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already offered sarcasm in his defense.
He drew heavy criticism in late July when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later said, "Of course I meant that sarcastically."
This method allows Mr. Trump to push linguistic boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
"I think one of his methods is to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they are received, and then, if necessary," clarify "depending on how the reaction is," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of softening the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more caustic tone, as his poll numbers have continued to decline.
A new NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist poll released Friday showed a large lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he has been increasingly the focus of attention in the final months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in the uncomfortable position of having to stand by him, no matter how provocative his statements.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is legitimate political commentary," Mr. Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Mr. Trump's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it backbenchers, completely wrong, and that is why he withdrew troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of campaign rallies in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of riding roughshod over his every word and being biased against him.
He taunted the "poor, pathetic" TV pundits trying to understand him, saying, "You can't!"
Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's apology as just further proof that he was unfit to be president.
Once ousted from the market over price, cafe in Greenpoint returns
Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg, where you could only pay in cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, prices have driven it out of its Bedford Avenue store front.
Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the latest loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is gutted and Verb is now a soap store."
But if New York is change, it is also reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly understated atmosphere.
The coffee is also still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and managing director of the new cafe.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered to provide funds for a new outpost, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, retained much.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon and cheese sandwiches and toppings such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Many old customers have also been displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and attended the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized it was because of the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even though that day she ordered a blended chai tea instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and invariably ordered the same thing.
"I came in at quarter past seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they make my bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
These days, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he alternates his bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no resentment that the soap business had taken over the old premises.
In fact, the soap's owners offered to make Cherie a special verb soap with the cafe's cold brewed coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we will respond to their offer," Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have also accepted the cafe.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to exhibit it soon so his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice bar wants to bottle and sell the cold brewed coffee.
There is a chance that the café will expand to an adjacent building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt, a regular customer, said he was devastated when the cafe closed.
When the new cafe opened, Whitt said that entering the eatery and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "an abundant meal"
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt had lunch in the Oval Office.
As a foodie, President Roosevelt had a soft spot for Fifth Avenue delicacies like pâte de foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu that day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and a plum pudding for dessert.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman's book, "97 Orchard," tells the story of life in a Lower East Side apartment building from a food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A Decent Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, no-frills takeaway in the Flatiron District that has been in business since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese sandwich with chunks of olive, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple found it appropriate for a discussion about food in the Great Depression era.
"Rich foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were made from one ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have settled in my stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" charts the ways in which the country dealt with being no longer the land of milk and honey.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense issue for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: Mysterious foods like breads and casseroles became staples, and the casserole was a "wonderful way to recycle leftovers," Ziegelman noted, because chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years was the center of American cuisine, became a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried, as calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even common sense.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at lunchtime," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continued: 'It was surreal.'
Peanut butter and baked onions don't go together.
It was typical of many of the household recipes.
Household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits like never before or since.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household policymakers" and rise to the challenge of turning pancakes like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
Particularly palatable are the reports of the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse cuisine of his kitchen, he dined like the multi-millionaire man of the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was gloriously out of touch with reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most dreary. "
Many of the Great Depression-era ways of dealing with food were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as how science has been applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple said they had a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother-in-law's eating habits - such as how she couldn't throw away food.
"She had a real fear of food waste," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," Ziegelman said, adding that giving humble recipes a fancy name was a common trick.
There was no whipped cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the tough, brown mica.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe won three golds.
Like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in Bomb Attack: He Was Aleppo's Hero
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that has so far saved nearly 60,000 lives, according to Bild newspaper.
2,900 volunteers are risking their own lives to pull people out of bombed-out homes and provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: in 2014, a video of him rescuing an infant from the rubble of a house went viral.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war.
But he never saw himself as a hero, saying, according to Bild: 'For me, this is real jihad.'
"When I die saving lives, I think that God sees me as a martyr."
Shortly before Omar himself was killed in an attack, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died and seven people are suffering from shortness of breath.
"We are now removing the toxic remnants of the bomb so that children do not play with it," Bild quoted his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb was meant to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed back into the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland sharks don't give birth until they are 150 years old.
The Greenland shark swims leisurely along the bottom of the North Atlantic, reaching an average of just 1,220 metres in an hour.
Only when it matters does the five-metre-long animal accelerate to a whopping 2.6 km / h - and at this top speed is half as fast as a seal.
However, this slow lifestyle seems to be a panacea for old age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science that a Greenland shark could be 392 years old.
"Madness," says Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, commenting on this lifespan, which is a world record for vertebrates.
The evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are becoming stone-old.
Except there was no evidence.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, as they live mainly in the Arctic Ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.
Because they prefer water temperatures of around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Accordingly, researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow-motion speed when they equipped six animals with a transmitter off Svalbard.
These sharks still prey: Researchers found the remains of a seal in one animal's stomach, and another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt dormant animals or patrol the bottom of the Arctic Ocean looking for carcasses that stagger down from higher layers of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland sharks caught by fishermen from the depths of the North Atlantic Ocean off Greenland or Spitsbergen between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest measured 502 centimetres.
To determine the age of the sharks, they used the carbon-14 method to analyze the lens core of the sharks.
This centre of the eye lens is formed even before the sharks are born, the proteins contained in it are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a remarkable amount of carbon-14 in their lens core.
They were therefore born after the early 1960 "s, when nuclear weapons tests released large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In contrast, the third smallest animal at 220 centimetres in length, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons tests, so it may have celebrated its 50th birthday when it was examined in 2012.
All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon-14 in their lens core, which is produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493-centimetre Greenland shark, while the record shark, at 502 centimetres, is likely to be 392 years old.
It was known that female Greenland sharks only produce offspring when they are longer than four metres.
The researchers were now able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland sharks obviously take at least one and a half centuries to reproduce.
That, too, should be a world record for vertebrates at the moment.
It is no coincidence that such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale with a 120-year-old harpoon tip stuck in its neck, was also caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flame.
So they mature later - and age more slowly.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often grow particularly large.
This is because the volume grows much faster than its surface, which causes the animal to lose heat.
The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of one gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
Ground in a double pack
In the most recent meeting, the local council focused on topics relating to construction.
The committee was relieved to hear from Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can finally begin."
After the land, parcelling and development issues have been clarified and the applications for surveying have been submitted, nothing stands in the way of the sale of the plots in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße area - development section 1) to interested parties.
The local council is convinced that the building sites in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal equally to young families and fit seniors.
As it was said, those wishing to build can now report to the town hall, and the local council is expected to discuss the allocation of the plots at its September meeting.
In order to be able to respond to requests for the establishment of further commercial enterprises in connection with the creation of jobs, the local council decided to amend the land use plan, which was only newly drawn up in the spring of this year, in some areas.
In the Unterzeitlarn area, for example, the business park already designated there will be expanded by two plots in the direction of the state road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city on the Main therefore has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, Head of Financial Markets and Property Markets at IW.
In the wake of the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether financial firms will be allowed to continue to operate from London across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far only been allowed to enter the UK.
Major US banks are taking advantage of this.
Several banks have already announced plans to relocate jobs.
The lobby group "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
According to the IW, Frankfurt is the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority (EIOPA) and the Risk Council (ESRB).
Although the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"Proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as it enables them to communicate directly with supervisors," says IW professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry but, like Dublin, performs worse on infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
The city also has readily available commercial real estate.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
On the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than its competitors thanks to good medical care and infrastructure, as well as less crime.
According to a ranking by management consultancy Mercer, the city ranks seventh, Luxembourg 19th, Dublin 33rd and Paris 37th.
Even if quality of life is a matter of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," concludes the IW.
But despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, economists say.
According to figures from Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking sector in London at the end of 2015, compared with 62,500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead Receives Legal Costs From Hepatitis C Patent Dispute With Merck
A U.S. district judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of legal costs incurred in its hepatitis C litigation with pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was cleared of paying $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni after a US judge uncovered a pattern of misconduct by Merck, including perjury and other unethical conduct.
In filing the lawsuit on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to relief from costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with the liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other claiming ownership of laboratory work based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
US-backed forces say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
US-backed forces have retaken full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (DKS) are currently combing the city following the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have been buried inside the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 civilians held hostage by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the DKS-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are carrying out cleanup," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn $10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had an income of $10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; the former secretary of state reported an income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's vice presidential nominee, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, released his tax returns from the past decade with his wife, Anne Holton.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to release their tax returns, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited a tax audit by tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
"The ball is in your court," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the release of the Democratic presidential nominee.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special counsel, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release anything until the tax audits are complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have already said that his refusal raises questions about his wealth, charitable donations, business dealings, and various other ties, particularly with Russia.
Clinton has already pounced on the issue, releasing a video online on Friday in which senior Republicans call on Trump to release his tax returns.
On Thursday, she also raised the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
'He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and release his tax returns, 'she told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid little or no taxes for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times business reporter on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants as saying that could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people earning more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, called on Trump to meet to discuss their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subjected to an IRS tax audit and that Trump was "afraid" of voters, not tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns dating back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clintons' 2015 tax return showed they earned only $100 of their income as wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons taxed dividends and income of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder, firecrackers boost Tanzania's elephant conservation
Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unorthodox way to stop elephants from entering human settlements - throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The method has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea years ago, has stepped up its support with the US Conservation Society by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Animal Welfare Day.
"Since we developed the... toolkit, we have seen a change in attitudes within these communities, where they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants," Honeyguide managing director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chilli powder mixed with soil is packed together with a firecracker into a condom, the end of which is closed to the fuse.
When lit, the condom bursts open with a bang and sprays fine dust of chili powder into the air.
A whiff quite usually already out to chase the elephant away.
A last possibility is a thrower that shoots a gold rain firework into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council decides unanimously: No kiosk construction on the banks of the Rhine in St. Goarer
Usually the St. Goarer accept investment projects from traders with a kiss hand - especially the retail trade in the core city is considered to be significantly expandable.
However, the city council unanimously rejected the application for the construction of a new sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony currently under construction.
"Basically we welcome new traders, but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine this kiosk does not fit," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU parliamentary group.
Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli code was removed after "Arab" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots sparked a media uproar after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli dialling code because Arab guests "requested it," according to a staff member.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country shortlist.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and erased?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to dial Israel through its own call center.
Seeking an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The response he received there "shocked him," Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the action was a "deliberate decision by Kempinski Hotels management."
The reason behind it provoked even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the area code be deleted," the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann.
Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called it a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and dismayed by this event.
This is really very shameful.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in this very hotel chain is an even greater shame.
This needs no explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident sparked quite a response on the internet, with people calling the whole thing a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of "caving in" to the alleged demands of Arab guests.
"Shame on you," read another post, pointing out that the hotel, which is located on the posh Kurfürstendamm, is close to a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all allegations, calling the incident an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"There was never a direct order" not to include Israel on the shortlist, "Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel as saying.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
The trouble began when police officers tried to disperse the students, leading to police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, slightly fewer than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on walls.
The latest protests came days after demonstrators took to the streets en masse in support of suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by a Senate vote to recall her.
Trade between Russia & Iran soars to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year, according to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since the lifting of international sanctions on Iran, interest in doing business in the country has grown sharply among Russian companies, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are establishing existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, the further development of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
Trade was boosted by deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons, "the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Mission abroad issued around 35,000 visas, mainly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
You could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year, will be broken, "he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witnesses sought: Beverage market raided in wildfire
A robbery took place on Thursday evening at the Rewe XXL beverage market on Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
At gunpoint, three people dressed in dark clothing, their faces masked, demanded cash from the beverage store employee and then fled on foot, presumably in a silver VW Golf.
Police did not say how much money was seized.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 metres tall, i.e. relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe-Markt and difficult to see.
After the attack, the perpetrators must have run in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the parking garage entrance with the silver car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who made any observations in connection with the robbery at the time of the crime (around 7.45pm) is urged to contact police as a matter of urgency.
Nagold: Fun and games in summer
The children and young people of the social pedagogical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nagold spent eight beautiful and happy days with their carers on their summer holiday in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
The cheerful group was accommodated in the quiet leisure home Hardtwäldle during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day excursions were on the program.
On the one hand we went to Bretten with a visit to the petting zoo.
On the other hand to Maulbronn, where there was a special guided tour for children in the world-famous monastery.
The third excursion led to Pforzheim.
In the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days the group enjoyed themselves at the Tiefensee in Maulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and splash.
Children and carers were spoiled with their own home-made dishes such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and Tübingen Bolognese.
In workshops batik was created, beautiful pieces of jewelry made of pearls and stones or a Roman mill game was made of wood.
Other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, evenings by the fire and the final "colourful evening."
On the day of the trip home, the sun was shining and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrimage to the Door of Mercy
The altar servers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were completed together.
In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage to Rome of all altar servers in probably two years, the Oberministrantenrunde St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a pilgrimage lasting several days.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and the decision was finally made for the episcopal city of Freiburg, where a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, with the Door of Mercy at the Freiburg Minster opened for this purpose.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern set off.
The evening before, Father Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and gave the pilgrim blessing.
From Horb we took the train to the starting point of Villingen, where there is also a cathedral of Our Lady and so the pilgrimage route from the cathedral was started.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and scriptural texts.
But also on the way the Minis stopped again and again at field crosses, chapels or churches to sing together a song from a specially compiled pilgrim song book.
Parishes of the local parishes were available for overnight stays.
At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as fortifying dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we continued via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day they started the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous part of the way, as they had to first descend about 500 metres in altitude in sweltering heat and then climb again.
The deserved reward was a barbecue at the pond in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, we set off on the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived at Freiburg Cathedral in the late afternoon and passed through the Door of Mercy.
With a small impulse God was thanked here.
In the evening Mass in the cathedral, the Minis arriving at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by co-ordinator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims could visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brit wins cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the velodrome in Rio last night as the British team defended their London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had adopted, and the youngster made the legend proud as he stormed home to claim a win from favourites New Zealand.
England claimed a shock victory four years ago while Hoy claimed the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after finishing a modest sixth at the Track World Championships in London in March, despite Hoy's retirement.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did so in time when Hindes showed up.
Hoy's retirement created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man they stuck with when they saw potential in the Scot that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hindes was just behind after his lap but Kenny put the team ahead and Skinner held on.
A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes driving in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny, and Skinner in particular, to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed to the podium.
Skinner, 23, from Glasgow, said: 'It's a flattering comparison.'
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After triumphing alongside Kenny and Hoy in 2012, Hindes admitted he deliberately fell off the track after a poor start.
He later retracted that statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such a resounding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said: 'It feels like London with all the GB flags in the stands.'
We have come together as a team over the last three months.
We came away with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If that is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, then we should expect a successful five days in the velodrome.
With Kenny's form, it is within the realm of possibility that he will repeat Hoy's win of three Olympic gold medals in one competition.
That would mean a haul of six gold medals and one silver for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently sacred date for British sport; the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born).
That would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny will next compete in the sprint, which starts today and will run over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: 'I'm just enjoying this for the moment.'
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your mates.
It feels a bit lonely to win on your own.
Hindes said: 'If he wins two more gold medals he should be knighted.'
It was the only medal contest of the day but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest time in the four-kilometre race.
They finished in 3: 51.942.
The world record, which won gold at London 2012, was 3: 51.659.
The first and final laps (22.42) take place today on the second day of the competition, with Wiggins sure to be the focus.
He had been arguing with officials before qualifying yesterday when officials called him in to measure his height.
In the women's event, which continues and finishes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time of 4: 13.260.
Team GB is relying on its strong track cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and pick up a slew of medals.
After a truly extraordinary display of utter dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio have been lowered.
Dramas played out in the background, including the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and bullying, and the retirement of the likes of Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But judging by the first night of competition in the velodrome, it looks as though GB's now legendary reputation, which peaked at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
Portland smelter's future in doubt due to energy contract cancellation
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - is at stake as the plant operator terminates its energy supply contract, cancelling all supply contracts, the supplier has announced.
The move follows the Victoria government's decision earlier this year not to award any further subsidies to operate the plant.
A 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at Alcoa's Portland plant are at stake.
As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk if the plant closes.
There could also be knock-on effects as the smelter consumes about 10 per cent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter in 2014, leading to the closure of the Anglesea power station last year.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risking closure.
The move follows years of speculation about the plant's future, initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently because of the price of electricity for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelter with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three other owners to terminate their contracts.
The plant is majority-owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp hold smaller stakes.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, which means further physical demand for electricity from the smelter," the company said.
AGL also said the contracts were so-called "hedging deals" that should have come into effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"As a result, AGL expects the contracts to contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," the electricity supplier said.
Any potential revenue impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by forecasts of strong wholesale electricity futures markets.
AGL said it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual accounts of $187 million in "anticipation of termination."
Alcoa said the decision to cancel the contracts did not affect Alcoa's "ability... to operate the smelter or provide power to the smelter."
The US company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into effect from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts have warned of the potential closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the industry's poor economic conditions.
Referring to analysts' statements earlier this week, head of operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both plants were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity market].
And it wouldn't be good for us as an electricity generator, "he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris, is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is a brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and has walked in Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
'In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry, 'Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-like?) scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of Rob and Caitlyn and in the presence of everyone's favorite showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest) forgetting their sister's cover and ending with a classic twist: they all planned a surprise party.
This is the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest delivered the line, "You thought we'd forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am slot), but Kris somehow had to let her other girls participate in the publicity.
The September issue of Vogue has certainly ushered in a new era for the Kardashians.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her to the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were featured on it in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine's September issue is a league of its own.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling issue of the year.
With a volume more akin to a coffee table book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, 615 pages of the 832 pages of the tome were advertisements).
The unveiling of its cover star is so eagerly awaited that images of the magazine have been leaked for the past two years ahead of its official announcement.
Women who have been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have clearly been more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the slim chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls into the former category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people, or reality stars, or today's teenagers, who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even if all of it applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone likes Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world has always been somewhat tense with her reality TV history.
In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and fellow model Gigi Hadid, calling them 'the bitches of the moment.'
Those feelings boiled over again when the news broke with Jenner's appearance on the Vogue cover.
But riding roughshod over grievance seems to miss the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She's literally a supermodel.
She runs for Marc Jacobs.
She's promoting her Estee Lauder primer.
She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she appears on reality TV, presumably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
Community centres turn away 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the country's most vulnerable are turned away from community centres each year as the industry braces itself for the impact of further funding cuts on already congested transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the resources for unfair deportation and the like - are already turned away when seeking free legal advice and assistance.
Community legal services, already overstretched, are bracing themselves for further cuts.
Starting next June, these legal centers are expected to lose another 30 percent of their federal funding.
Queensland Community Law Centres director James Farrell said the latest survey by the National Association of Community Law Centres showed thousands of people are already turned away every year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government's decision.
"Queensland's community justice centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are being turned away from vital services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debts, families going through separations, workers who have been unfairly dismissed - all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, meaning thousands of Queensland's more vulnerable people will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney-General and Federal Justice Minister, as well as Queensland Senator George Brandis, to immediately reverse these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need when they have legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its pledge to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centres and their client communities and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign indicted after staffer allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after it was revealed that its North Carolina campaign manager pointed a gun at a staffer while they were traveling in a Jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in Charlotte state court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini said he waited months for the matter to be resolved internally before realizing that "it wouldn't happen."
The campaign manager, Earl Philip, "pulled a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the barrel into Vincent's knee," Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he said in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause harm," Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused an uproar when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" - gun owners and gun enthusiasts - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appoints judges.
Trump's campaign made clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordi's complaint seeks damages from the campaign for breach of duty of care and from Philip for bodily harm and permanent emotional harm.
Trump's press secretary Hope Hicks could not be reached for comment.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
Calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, were not answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign so far.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin / Schwerin: Poll before state elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), considerable losses are looming for the governing parties SPD and CDU.
This was the result of representative surveys conducted by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black governing coalition in the north could continue to govern narrowly, this is not possible according to the poll results in Berlin.
In both Länder, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would therefore have a good chance of continuing to be the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD plummeted from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the poll, this puts the party just ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
Third place is disputed between the Left and the AfD.
The Left would get 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented in the state parliament for the first time with 19 percent.
Despite slight losses, the Greens returned to the Schwerin state parliament with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the state parliament with 3 percent each.
According to the poll, the SPD would only get 23 percent in the Berlin parliamentary elections (2011 election: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It would still be behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the lower house of parliament for the first time with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, while the Pirates would miss out on entry in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
Email and the Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, Nokia Communicator was launched.
Its successors now dominate the world - its manufacturer suffered a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times the weight of an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it didn't sit well in the hand.
On the contrary, it was rather clunky.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies today.
An iPhone now ships with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" was launched exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, enthusiasts can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow date back to the Stone Age of the Internet age.
But 20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as a "pocket-sized office."
In fact, the new mobile phone could do a lot for the standards of the time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, and the communicator could also be reached by fax.
Even access to websites was possible via an HTML browser, albeit painfully slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be opened like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.
Pretty proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the Communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything has changed since then.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and wound up.
The market is now dominated by suppliers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Being online anytime and anywhere is a daily occurrence for many people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices have been sold, with Samsung and Apple alone accounting for 555 million units.
Worldwide sales of the devices amount to around 400 billion euros.
Add to that the well-running business of countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
In the meantime, an entire industry has emerged around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came at the beginning of 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone at the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an Internet communicator, all easy to use via touch screen.
Apple's triumphant march began, and the iPhone is still the company's most important product today.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, which dominated the market, lost out.
They eventually disappeared, and Blackberry has struggled.
Apple and Asian suppliers such as Samsung now call the shots.
Twenty years after its invention, the smartphone is a given.
On average, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put our smartphones away," said Janina Kugel, who is responsible for human resources at Siemens.
Permanent accessibility has become both a curse and a blessing.
England must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not just to our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, that was Heathrow's biggest attraction, just as it was for London 2012, when we went to great lengths to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do that again by creating new opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport area.
Just as they were ahead of us at London 2012, there will be those who think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great.
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong again at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked of it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not the few.
Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn of economic growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row - to T2, built in the middle of the world's two busiest runways.
Now they stand ready to deliver a third runway, aided by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will be one of them.
It is time we channelled that Olympic spirit and expanded Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and jobs of which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "cat-and-mouse game" over ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad blocking amount to a "cat and mouse game," according to one of the software companies.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ads on its desktop page, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding of its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to detect which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way around the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-forth battle between the ad-blocking open source community and the bypassers has been going on since the invention of ad blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has joined the fight is a strong indication of how worrisome ad blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use ad blockers, nearly four times as many in 2013, according to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook through their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs because mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesman said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large share of revenue for Facebook to consider the investment of such a move worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its "ad preference tool" to give people more control over ads targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the issue," a Facebook spokesman said in an emailed statement.
Ad blockers are a blunt tool, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools like ad preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Woman run over on Swiss motorway in suspected suicide
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in a suspected suicide.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down on the street in the dark "in an act of desperation" and was hit by several cars, Vaud police said.
It is clear that a Swiss woman, aged 49, who was run over by several vehicles, including a lorry, wanted to kill herself.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but some have still not been identified, said police, who are urging them and any witnesses to the incident to come forward.
An investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers will be charged.
Was a collision avoidable?
That's something the prosecutor has to decide, "Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the past five years show that drivers are not being held accountable.
In each of the two cases - in which a person was walking on the motorway in the dark - it was decided that motorists did not have to assume that a pedestrian was walking on the motorway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policewoman was cleared of negligent homicide after she ran over and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and passed out in the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified manner and that the presence of a man in the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with further information about Thursday's incident near Morges should contact police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable, according to projections from a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere, might have once had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and was still spinning slowly.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more arid areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dull.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day side to the sun for nearly two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures that are several degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously suspected by planetary scientists.
Although it was once thought to be habitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over billions of years.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, citing a lack of participation in the team's decision-making process.
Alternate President / General Manager of the Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately search for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have performed my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I thought long and hard over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently being met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of this decision today," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him all the best for the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach during his debut season with the Avalanches in 2013-14.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the playoffs by Minnesota and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches posted a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell five points behind the Wild for a second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.
As a Hall of Fame goalie, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Industrial action over pay for North Sea oil workers will be suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield services provider Wood Group have been sporadic on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute," it said in a joint statement.
We will be holding some full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next year, to address the issues anew.
Unions said their latest strike, the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates on its North Sea contractors by around 9 per cent this year due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate cut follows a 10 percent drop for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts will give the company the space it needs to get through the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has laid off thousands of people and announced plans to close its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation exacerbated by Britain's decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with Labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest industrial disputes to hit the North Sea in a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for the many, not the few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea, compared with an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different rates and how the rotation periods are related to planet formation.
"By comparing our results with other star clusters, we hope to learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a press release.
The star cluster of the Pleiades is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, which formed around 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They are spinning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these maturing stars emit large amounts of stellar winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable starspot -- such as sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
"In the" ballet "of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Because the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The Pleiades cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still a long way to go and we would like to know more about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their "dancing shoes."
Rebull and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades in three newspaper reports, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
Controversial baseball star steps down
The tears ran faster from base to base for Alex Rodriguez than the U.S. baseball star in his prime.
Following his emotional retirement announcement, the 41-year-old pro will wear his New York Yankees jersey for one last time on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays.
'I love this game and this team, 'he said.
"I say 'goodbye' to both," the 14-time All-Star Game participant told Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was voted the league's most valuable player three times, winning the World Series with the Yankees in 2009.
His signature on a 10-year contract has earned him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of his contract on 31 December 2017, he will continue to act as a consultant and youth coach - on a full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back with performance.
With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994-2000), the Texas Rangers (2001-2004) and, since 2005, the Yankees, he achieved some milestones.
With Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar scores in key statistics.
But the 41-year-old is unlikely to be inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame.
For as successful as Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - has been on the field, his off-the-field demeanor has been controversial.
Back in 2009, the superstar admitted to ESPN that he had taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was banned for 211 games until the end of 2014 due to his involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is considered a prime suspect for receiving performance-enhancing drugs for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal battle, the ban was reduced to 162 matches.
"The league might even have done me a favor in 2014 because I played 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said smugly at the time.
His farewell days are not without noise, either.
While many baseball legends return to the big stage in their final games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
'My job doesn't involve a farewell tour. '
"My job is to try to win every game," Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is said to have had relationships with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received expressions of sympathy from fans of Yankee archrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," supporters chanted during the 4-9 loss to Rodriguez's team.
Olympics 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Weightlifter Adrian Zielinski of Poland is banned from competing in Rio due to a positive doping test.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics will be overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
An athlete caught cheating almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases have come to light at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter steeplechaser Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski have tested positive and been banned in Brazil - just before the start of the already critical athletics competitions.
Chen was found last Sunday to have the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Court of Sport (CAS) confirmed her exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon local time.
The 18-year-old finished fourth in the 100m butterfly final on Sunday, missing out on a bronze medal by just 0.09 seconds.
Chen was due to compete in the 50m freestyle heats on Friday.
Chen has asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B sample and hold a hearing.
The national federation takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigation," Xinhua quoted a statement as saying: "We will cooperate with the International Court of Sport (CAS) and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, it is no longer the IOC but CAS that is responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, news of Danekova's positive test leaked out, with the 33-year-old going on the offensive herself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she told Bulgarian TV channel BNT.
She is innocent, "the only explanation could be supplements," the athlete said.
According to the report, the banned substance is said to be the blood doping drug EPO.
Danekova has been provisionally suspended, with the B sample also said to have tested positive, according to BNT.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borisov was quick to criticise the athlete.
"I do not understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-ridden nation will not be allowed to compete in Rio.
The case of Adrian Zielinski, the London Olympic champion in the 85kg class, was also announced on Friday. Like his brother Tomasz, he tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone three days earlier.
Both deny taking the drug, but both are banned from competing in the class up to 94kg.
Before the start of athletics, the Danekova case in particular is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The world governing body, the IAAF, had banned all but one of the Russian team for systematic doping, and the running nation of Kenya also produced plenty of bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the earlier offences in China had also caused fierce disputes between the athletes.
France's Camille Lacourt harshly attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang pees purple."
"When I see the podium in the 200m freestyle, I want to vomit," Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of an altercation with Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time or respect for doping cheats," he said.
Sun tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the 2014 Chinese championships but only served a three-month suspension.
Data theft: How perfidious hackers extort their ransom
Programmers of extortion malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been victims of an attack with extortion software at least once, sometimes several times, in the past twelve months.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of ransomware extortion.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators increasingly specialize their extortion software in attacks on corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potential ransom to be extorted is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently witnessing an alarmingly rapid evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in an interview with Die Welt.
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the shift to corporate attacks has occurred alarmingly quickly in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, it searches specifically for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypted the Ransomware and deletes the originals permanently.
The software then presents the extortioners "demands.
In order to get the final encryption code to the files, victims must transfer money - usually in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.
Accordingly, the damage is higher if a Ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported loss of sales due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt business completely, in one case people were in danger of their lives.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been the victims of attacks whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always say to victims: don't pay, you're just promoting the problem," Kleczynski says.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to reject the perpetrators "demands in the face of stagnation in operations.
The hackers, on the other hand, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, the security researchers at F-Secure examined the user interfaces and contact with the extortioners and came to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to set up a kind of customer service in order to earn more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how to pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies sometimes have to negotiate hard and pay five-figure sums in order to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware extortion, the hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."
It is more likely, however, that it is three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price of between $1000 and $10,000.
"It comes with a customization tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," Wisniewski says.
The extortionists then look for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from a criminal and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually the criminals then hire spammers to spread it," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of Ransomware is now known at many companies, which back up their data better.
More than 50 percent of the company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust that they can fend off ransomware using file back-ups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat for successful extortion, the perpetrators instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
Depending on the type of data, the damage potential is thus many times higher than before.
The perpetrators could also target completely new targets on the Internet of Things in the future.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, unlocking such a blocked heater could well be worth a ransom to some victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.
One for all
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda wants to pack everything into the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupe and even the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds rather cluttered, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V, which is only 1.60 m high, appears rather small, the passengers have plenty of space both in the front row and in the rear, and it does not appear cramped at any point.
The materials of the interior are well finished and look pleasant, only the upper side of the cockpit falls off a bit.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage space.
There is not only a luggage compartment of 453 l with raised backrests and 1026 l with folded backrests, but there are also the "Magic Seats."
This is less magical than it sounds: the seats in the back seat fold up like cinema chairs, offering storage space that is 1.24 m high from floor to ceiling.
The boot is easy to load, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully in wide speed ranges thanks to torque of up to 300 Nm.
He should be doing his job a bit more quietly, though.
The everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.
There is another engine: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.
Four-wheel drive is not offered.
The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment in the tested top variant "Executive" leaves nothing to be desired.
Safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (works up to 32 km / h), the Collision Warning System and Lane Keep Assist.
The collision detector is sometimes irritating because it rates many obstacles as "approaching objects" when manoeuvring.
The high beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent cruise control reacts to traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed if necessary.
Full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, sat nav, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI socket are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to reach.
The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20,000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.
The engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline not liable: Fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because a liability is conceivable only with dangers, which are typical for the air traffic, argued the higher regional court Duesseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124 / 14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk to life, the court heard.
The airline did not have to pay compensation to the man.
Illness: When does the organiser pay?
Ill holidaymakers will only get money back after their trip if the cause of the illness can be found in the hotel without a doubt.
However, this is only the case if more than ten per cent of guests have been shown to show the same symptoms.
In the case being heard, a family fell seriously ill with diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their holiday to Turkey.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
The holidaymakers attributed their illness to a faulty sewage treatment plant that allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family felt the trip was flawed - and sued the tour operator.
In court, the plaintiffs were unsuccessful.
The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer only found out about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
Until then, he had to assume that the seawater was OK.
He did not violate his information obligations, the ruling said.
Especially since no impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion among themselves - belongs to the general life risk.
Out of 691 guests, only 38 fell ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The state must react calmly and decisively at the same time to terrorist threats.
What is certain is that our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not begrudge the terrorists this triumph.
If criminals had to leave the country more quickly, however, this would increase security and also strengthen popular support for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants the proposals to be implemented by the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced a further reinforcement of the security forces, "in the mid-four-digit range over several years."
Sympathy for terrorism should be made a criminal offence again.
Video surveillance is to be improved and gun laws amended in such a way as to make it more difficult, in particular, to buy weapons online.
According to de Maiziere, the recently much discussed duty of confidentiality for doctors should be maintained.
However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he wants to look for solutions to reduce the risk to the public, he said, with a view, for example, to mental disorders.
In order to counteract the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister believes that better social care is necessary.
Teachers need to be better prepared to deal with traumatised people.
To prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (darknet), de Maizière plans to use undercover investigators.
SPD leader Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security."
It was important that the Minister of the Interior spoke out clearly against actionism.
"This was a slap in the face for the snipers in the CDU / CSU," Gabriel told the Funke Mediengruppe newspaper on Friday.
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a burqa ban and the abolition of dual nationality.
He considers a general ban on full veiling to be constitutionally problematic.
You can't ban everything you disagree with and I disagree with wearing the burqa.
One could talk about rules, for example in traffic or for witnesses in court.
Greens leader Simone Peter accused the minister of trying to simulate energy and ability to act with ever new anti-terror packages.
Left-wing party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "A tightening of the right of residence will not bring more security to the people of this country."
Improved traffic flow on the motorway feeder
It regularly jams up on the bypass - here's a picture from November.
But that is about to change: the right-hand turn lane is to be extended.
This is good news for motorists who are stuck in traffic on the surrounding road every evening during rush hour as they drive along the A43 motorway.
Next Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August), Landesbetrieb Straßenbau will extend the right-hand turn lane by 700 metres in the area between Hammer Straße and the Weseler Straße exit.
Drivers can then turn right directly from Hammer Straße.
The big advantage is that traffic splits up earlier, which improves overall traffic flow on the busy section of Interstate 51.
The idea for the extended exit came from the CDU faction in the Münster-West district assembly.
The narrowing of the road on the feeder particularly annoys drivers between 5 and 7 p.m.
On weekdays, the backlog extends to the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the eye of the needle on the B 51 shortly before the Weseler Straße exit.
From here, traffic will only be diverted in one lane over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be dismantled a good three quarters of a year ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to accommodate heavy goods traffic in two lanes.
How long this bottleneck and the associated weekday traffic jam will last, the responsible state company cannot say.
However, it is expected to take years: the bridge will have an official residual service life until 2034.
For the extension of the right-hand turn lane, the state company deliberately chose the less congested time during the school holidays, because obstructions were to be expected.
Traffic will pass the construction site in one lane on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural Journey: Cultural activities for schools
The international class of the Forest School attended the play "The Invisible House."
The association Nima's and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The association Nima's enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus attended a performance of the award-winning play "Das insichtbare Haus" by the Junge Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the Nima's association, 19 pupils aged between eleven and 15 visited the production in the Kleines Haus.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, has offered schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the young people in the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, among others, and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, scenic images and video animations, they were still able to follow the course of the action, according to the press release of the Junges Theater Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without refugee and migrant backgrounds between the ages of 14 and 20 will have the opportunity to attend professionally supervised courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre and theatrical language teaching are being planned.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
In view of the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of shooting stars: Hope for better weather
The weather has put a stop to shooting stars in the southwest of Germany on Friday night - but there is still hope.
Due to clouds and rain, the night was ill-suited for observing the celestial spectacle, said Hans-Ulrich Keller, chairman of the Welzheim observatory, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on Saturday night.
The weather should be good, then we will surely see many shooting stars in the sky.
The star scales are Perseids, which, at 216,000 kilometres per hour, are among the fastest shooting stars.
They get their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Relaxing night: Tips against insomnia
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think about sleep long before the alarm rings.
This is far from relaxing.
After all, one is in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders, and more than ten percent often or permanently experience their sleep as not restorative.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be based on a variety of causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is commonly understood by this, however, is insomnia, i.e. a disturbance of falling asleep and sleeping through.
Straight through sleep feels many humans as unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, executive committee member in the German family doctor federation with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
This can be due to organic, psychological or behavioural factors, as well as medication.
It is not uncommon for a sleep disorder to be an expression of another disease.
"Very early waking is common, especially with depression," Weeß says.
And it may be that different factors determine each other.
For example, someone who has a herniated disc can lie down badly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly begins to think about everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should I go to the doctor with insomnia?
Anyone who does not sleep well for at least three nights a week for a period of one month and is impaired during the day should see a doctor, advises Weeß.
The impairment can look very different: one is exhausted, tired, unrested, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.
In order to alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There are hardly any established sleep physicians in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine center of the Charité University Medical Center Berlin.
Therefore one should first turn to the family doctor in case of sleep problems, advises Weeß.
He can clarify with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens there?
For example, physicians advise examinations in the sleep laboratory in cases of snoring with respiratory failure, pathological daytime fatigue, sleepwalkers, or if the cause of a sleep disturbance is not found, Fietze explains.
You don't really have to prepare for the examination.
You should spend the day as normal.
"Just don't take a nap, please," Fietze says.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear nose glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can those affected get a grip on the problems?
There are quite a few adjustments you can make for a better sleep.
Weeß enumerates: Regular bedtime and getting up, not lying in bed too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to calculate immediately, and that is not at all conducive.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing swimming medals
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented on the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis via Facebook.
In December 2014, he won gold for the first time at the World Short Track Championships in Doha, setting his first world record in the process.
Now former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has taken to Facebook to defend himself against his former team-mates who have come in for criticism.
'In a country where an Olympic champion is paid €20,000 and a jungle king €150,000, no one should be surprised at the lack of medals, 'the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The support system in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not take a close look at, or even practise, doping.
"I'm not saying the controls should stop here," he said.
If he wanted to make a comeback, Deibler would have to be registered with the German National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) nine months before his first start.
It should be the same with countries.
"If you can't be controlled by independent WADA / FINA inspectors for a certain period of time before the World Championships / OS, you are not allowed to participate," demands the Hamburger, who now runs an ice cream parlour.
Airport: Gang of baggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, plainclothes investigators from the Düsseldorf police succeeded in arresting two women and two men aged 50 to 61.
The suspects had committed several bag and luggage thefts as a gang.
Around 9.30 p.m., plainclothes officers in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to police from past theft offences.
The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July this year and had acted in a collaborative, division of labour and in a particularly professional manner.
The specialists of the Criminal Inspectorate 34 can prove four crimes to the thieves, who had entered Germany specifically to commit crimes.
They had captured a total of more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few lime trees, a few cobblestones in between: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain may not seem like it at first glance, but the police consider it one of the city's "dangerous places."
If you walk along the road from east to west, you will pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a health food store.
Someone sprayed "ugly!" on the facade of a grey house.
Across the street from a Lidl, which is also due to be demolished soon, construction is already under way: a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be built here by 2017.
Articles about this "trendy district," as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, have been illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks.
The reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, now the inhabitants have leases, but on the ground floor rooms are still occupied and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, Berlin's Senator for the Interior, Henkel, in particular, has repeatedly called for a police crackdown on the project, describing the area as a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence.
After 300 police officers cleared the ground-floor rooms, the Kadterschmiede, on June 22, the police patrolled the area for three weeks with 30 to 40 officers and three ambulances, cordoned off parts of the street and prevented visitors from entering the house with number 94, according to official statements.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers left amid cheers from sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk before late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the neighborhood since 1999, and Jana *, who is raising three children here, are particularly annoyed by the police presence.
They share concerns about rising rents and gentrification with residents of the housing projects.
It doesn't sound like a neighborhood that wanted police protection from vandalizing leftists.
The rift that the Berlin Senator for the Interior and the police are opening between squatters and their neighbours does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which still has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
Squatting and the resulting housing projects have also long been part of the neighbourhood: in 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainzer Strasse near Riga.
While the people of Mainz were evicted in a real street battle under a large police presence, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still partly inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and Berliners from all over the world: residents from the GDR era and former squatters now share their neighbourhood with them.
This is also reflected in rents, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 for new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols of this development: they can be recognized by discarded windows or freshly painted facades that have been pelted with paint bags.
No other street has been mentioned so often this year along with the words "leftist violence."
One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, crimes such as assault are almost exclusively directed against police officers.
Property damage accounts for the majority of crimes, and tends to affect new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a tenement building next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of uncertainty.
When it comes to violence, it's reassuring: the people in 94 are their neighbors, and they certainly weren't.
Even the famous burning cars have not been seen in Riga for some time.
For the trained architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than anywhere else."
Neugebauer deliberately moved to Rigaer Straße - and stayed there.
That is why it was so important to her that the residents get their street back: from the police, politicians and the media, who suddenly claimed sovereignty over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street continues to be taken away from them: by faceless new buildings in former vacancies that displace the old residents.
"At the end of the day, these are condominiums that aren't interesting to a lot of people here - people who aren't well-heeled tend to live here," she says.
'I absolutely don't condone violence and destruction. '
But what are you supposed to do if no one ever listens?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little sympathy for newcomers who are annoyed by paint bombs: the house projects and the left-wing scene were part of the neighborhood.
Anyone who moves here should be aware of this - just as someone who moves to a pub district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is the new Refugee Commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organisation.
She is also a local social worker.
Annika Deuschle has been the Refugee Commissioner for Urbach since July.
The social pedagogue supports the administration team headed by Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a point of contact for all stakeholders: refugees, the Refugee Aid Working Group, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine Kunde from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is here, the egg-laying woolly sow, who has a problem above all.
This is what some had meant when the administration wanted to advertise the job - not so much mocking as aiming at the multitude of desirable tasks.
We were looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, namely an egg-laying woolly sow.
But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all it is about organisation, working with the people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been with the club for around six weeks.
She has a 50 per cent job for three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.
Soon there will be new containers in Wasenstrasse
It has been a serious problem for some time to find housing for the refugees who have been recognised.
The municipalities are responsible for the connecting accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented accommodation.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
Responsibility shifts from the district office to the municipality and job centre.
Problem: There are vacant properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private housing.
So far, it has not worked, relying on private housing, Deuschle said.
That is why, as the saying goes, communal housing needs to be upgraded.
So soon new containers will be installed in Wasenstrasse.
But it's not just apartments.
Perspective is the key word, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to permanent accommodation, there are traineeships, apprenticeships, school places, one-euro jobs and temporary work for refugees and migrants that need to be found or set up.
"More seats would be good," says Regine Kunde.
Many work in the building yard or help caretakers, do community service - and that motivates and very neatly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes the work will have a positive impact on the community.
This is "not occupational therapy."
Activity does not just mean work.
The day needs a fixed structure, Deuschle and the customer say.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So there is a need for sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So administrators and volunteers are stepping in.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings was a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and that they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses.
Anyone who develops the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach, is not allowed to work and is useless, will never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
But there are also problem cases, says Kunde honestly, "people with whom nothing is possible." Therefore, the work of Deuschle and Kunde is always also to motivate others.
He said it was all a "mammoth task."
A difficult question: after the recent events, are they afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," Regine Kunde says quite clearly, "which some might call naive." However, she cannot and does not want to rule out a residual risk.
But the helpers are already aware of this.
These incidents are also an issue for the refugees.
They are afraid that the assassins will bring them into complete disrepute.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So full-time and volunteer workers on the ground and in the region need to look out for activities.
They always have in mind that a new influx of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a cap?
Politicians shy away from answering this question clearly.
Actually, it's unfair to put them on the spot.
"In Urbach we are not yet where we want to be," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would ease the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the people of Urbach are already busy integrating the existing people sensibly.
There are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they need to be helped, both women agree.
The political situation in the world is so complicated that there are no easy answers.
Schorndorf: Burglars sought by helicopter
The police helicopter flew over different areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unidentified men violently broke into an apartment in an apartment building in Lindenweg at around 8.50am on Friday morning.
The inhabitant surprised the two and beat the bad guys to escape.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 metres tall, well masked, both wearing blue jeans and black hoodies.
They fled towards the city centre.
Police deployed several patrol crews and a police helicopter to the scene.
The search was unsuccessful.
The unidentified men may have been seen near the apartment before the crime or during their escape.
Baden-Württemberg: Police investigate after rocker attack on takeaway
After an attack on an Ulm snack bar, police are investigating six suspects from the rocker milieu for serious breach of the peace.
Evidence and drugs were seized during house searches, police said on Friday.
Around 20 masked men from a rocker-like group had thrown bottles and stones at the window of a takeaway in July, according to police.
They then allegedly attacked two guests and slightly injured one.
Then they fled.
Damage to the snack bar and the adjacent building amounted to 10,000 euros.
According to the investigators, it is a dispute in the Ulm rocker milieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
