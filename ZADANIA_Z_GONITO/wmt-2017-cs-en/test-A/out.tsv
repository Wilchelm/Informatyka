28-year-old chef found dead in store in San Francisco
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was this week's steps of the local store.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, and he adds:
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old resident of San Francisco's Frank Galicia, the medical examiner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation is under way.
Brother of the victim Louis Galicia for the ABC KGO station in San Francisco said that Frank, who was previously a regular chef in Boston, obtained his dream job of a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesperson for the Sons & Daughters' restaurant said it was his death giveaways to be shocked and destroyed by the giveaways.
We've got a small team working as a closely-connected family.
At this difficult time, our thoughts and grief are to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank had first slept in the accommodation, but that a recently homesick had finally begun to do.'
Freshman wannabes Find an apartment, went with the girl, texting 'Louis Galicia for KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to join the family, he was always cooking us food, he made us dinner, Singaporeans told Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any argument.
He was a brother who took things the way they are.
Scoring a dunk even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was a no-brainer diamond that lit up every day of scoring, he said.

The Czech Railways has invested more than $31 billion in modernization.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the past six years, the state-owned carrier has invested more than $31 billion in vehicle upgrades.
One-third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, roughly half of the trains have a new system closed by WC.
However, the amounts for modernisation in individual years, with the exception of 2012, are gradually decreasing.
The Czech Railways has invested more than $31 billion in upgrading vehicles over the past six years.
One-third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, roughly half of the trains have a new system closed by WC.
The money spent has been shown to reduce the average age of two years for locomotives and separate units and six years for classic cars.
A larger share of investment has put the carrier in regional transport, where it headed roughly 60 per cent of that money, 40 per cent then invested in restoring vehicles for long-haul traffic.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years old.
But upgraded older vehicles are counted in this indicator as entirely new.
If vehicle upgrades were not expected, the average age of driving vehicles would increase by a decade.
Slightly older are the average passenger cars, whose average age when set up by modernization is 23 years old.
If taken into account only the age from the date of production, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
In recent years, classic sets of wagons and towed locomotives have been gradually disappearing from both Czech and global railways and are being replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the locomotive from 280 to 223 pieces, similarly dropped the number of classic cars from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
The carrier was rid of, in particular, of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the journey.
From January to July, the carrier had scrapped 110 of these cars.
For example, the purchase of 50 cars for speeds within 200 kilometres of the hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract to purchase electric units for domestic fast-track routes can be introduced, for example, from investments that are envisaged in the vehicle fleet in the near future.
The contract provides for up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 units of electric units.
For a quarter of a year, the authorities know about illegal advertising, they can't get rid of it.
We are utterly helpless, they acknowledge.
For a quarter of a year, the newspaper's online journal News has been following the story of a billboard in the southern Bohemia, which is now inviting motorists to visit Leipzig, where it is not only a tourist's interesting walk in the treetops, but also the Olympic Park.
The trustees know that it's illegal, but they say there's nothing they can do about it.
Such ads are hundreds, maybe thousands, across the country.
According to officials, a shaky law is at fault for which illegal mobile billboards can't be removed immediately.
What is needed is a complex bureaucratic circle.
But in the meantime, the company will change its name and the office is short on it.
Or just advertise a few meters, and the official process has to start again.
A quarter of a year ago, roads and motorways have been admitted: The main drag from České Budějovice to Leipzig is on our grounds at the state road advertising billboard.
Less than three months, however, officials have not been able to get rid of the unauthorised portable structure with a giant advertising poster.
It was as if no one cared that he was standing close to the road, in a 50-foot security zone where nothing was allowed to stand for security.
Road managers claim that they can't simply cope with the billboard because of the Children's Act.
Maybe pick him up and take him away.
Chilling Reveals That must not just be allowed, a spokesman says roads and highways Nina Ledvin, and refers to the complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must be prevented under the law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began with the online journal Current News in the spring, is not unique, pointing to a general problem that cannot stand and the authorities effectively and quickly address.
In the southern Czech Republic, dozens of similar mobile ads were counted against the rules close to the road or nearby.
There are other counties on it.
Internally, we have the difficulty of forcing the instructors to remove the tacklers, citing the head of the transport department of Chechnya's regional office, Jiri Klara, whose colleagues are dealing with such stories.
According to Klara, the feckless law that officials tie up is to blame.
First, he has to elaborate on the billboard's owner to put the ad away.
But the company's bosses are often elusive or have known the trick, which has been described in the past, when it has become more interested in the issue: Just a mobile stand with advertising moves a few meters away, and officials can throw a previous call to remove the black advert in the bin.
That's because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
Verdict Revealed If someone messes it up and the coordinates suddenly disapprove, it looks at it as a new device and we must address the owner again, 'explains George Clark.
The new law doesn't help.
The change could bring a new law that will ban billboards by motorways from September next year and will limit them to the roads of the Grade I class.
Critics point out that the rules for tackling illegal and easily transferable ads will remain the same as ever.
And the authorities are not so alarmed.
Companies can continue to earn tens of hundreds of millions of crowns per year on rentals of illegal areas, and no one can.
For example, a billboard appealing to Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: The pending magistrate is currently conducting three administrative proceedings for the black-sided billboards.
The company faces a $1,000 fine in each trial.
These are more ads that have been placed without permission in the protection zone of Class I.
The proceedings are not yet closed, says Jaroslav Mzec, head of the Department of Transportation of the Czech Republic.
The advertisement that News is interested in, although not yet featured among these cases, will most likely come to them soon.
According to a spokesperson for the Order of the Nines Ledvin, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will be reached on the table by the county and then probably Magistrates' Court.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious firms that have not been able to contact.
She didn't take the mail, and the official residence on Live was cancelled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company's mail company went to the Southwest entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who famously sparked a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representation of the Hyundai brand.
However, Fischer, whose Euro Billboard area has been leased from Comerz Billboard and offers them to advertisers, has rejected any link in the past.
Meanwhile, this spring, when the SD began to be interested in advertising on Lipno, Fischer let state officials send a letter to the mysterious company, Commerz Billboard, to its boardroom, where the company is alleged to be based.
That address, however, has not been heard from the highways of the highways.
A futile fight.
Such silences or opaque changes are not unusual.
We gradually gave up fines for two million crowns a few years ago.
But it changed the name and the ID, and there was nothing to deal with.
The executor had returned the case, and the ads were on, maybe in other places.
We are helpless against such firms and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, he admits, under the condition of maintaining the anonymity of one of the officials.
No one solves the law in this respect so far.
The news has spoken with several MPs that have taken the issue.
But they have not yet developed any activity.
On the contrary, there were MPs who wanted to extend the term for maintaining billboards in the main Czech communications.
The government rejected that.
Billboards are not only national, but also regional and municipal policies a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic subject.
On the one hand, they know about social demand for their limitations, on the other hand, they need them because of the adverts in the election campaigns.
I don't get the fairly established impression that if something doesn't work, it's the need to change the laws.
Farmers will reap less grain this year, but more rivers and poppy, the statisticians estimate.
According to estimates by the Czech Bureau of Statistics, the grain harvest will be 6.7 per cent lower this year than last year.
Yet this year's crop has been above average over the past five or ten years.
Higher will, on the other hand, harvest the cut -LRB- of 3.9 per cent -RRB- and mint -LRB- 2.5 per cent -RRB-.
Grain harvesting will be 6.7 per cent lower this year than last year.
Farmers harvest 7.2 million tonnes of grain.
It follows from an estimate reported by the Czech Statistical Office on 15 July.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic, and assumed a ten-year decline against last year.
But last year's grain harvest was above average.
This year's crop exceeds the average for the past five or ten years.
In contrast, there will be a harvest of raspberries and poppy this year.
Cut by the group's growers of 3.9 per cent more than a year ago they got below the roof of 1.256 million tonnes.
This year's crop of mint could be 2.5 per cent higher than last year's.
The expected drop in cereal production is due to a reduction in the hectic yield of 3.7 per cent to 5.71 tons of hectares, as well as the decline in the cropping area.
Farmers cropped up three percent fewer fields this year.
Wheat ozimé, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is estimated to be 3.3% less this year.
At the same time, the farmers cut her to more fields.
But there will be a lower heckless yield on the decline, which drops to 6,04 tonnes.
Roughly one-fifth decline in the statistic is forecast for the barley spring, which is most commonly used to produce beer.
In the wake of the reduction in the crop, it costs a reduction in tight-knit areas by 15.2 per cent, but also a lower hectic return.
On the other hand, barley grain yields a 6.3 per cent higher.
The harvest of rye will also grow.
The crop's crop is estimated at 1.305 million tonnes, which is more than last year.
In fact, the crop area expanded by 7.3 per cent.
But the hectic yield will be 3.2 per cent lower than last year.
This year's crop of cutbacks will exceed the 10-year average of 13.3 per cent, meeting them on the area by a third more extensive than a decade ago.
There have also been fields with poppy in the last four years.
This year, the farmers cut him to 35.543 hectares.
Against 2008, when a poppy in the Czech Republic has grown to record 70,000 hectares, the field is half that.
Thanks to the expansion of tight-knit areas, this year's harvest will make the mint richer.
It will rise by 2.5 per cent to 27 423 tonnes last year.
But the hectic yield will be 6.1 per cent lower.
Olomouc police have charged two men for assault with a knife and machete, a court has sent them into custody.
Police charged two assailants who attacked a knife and a machete-wielding five-year-old man on Tuesday in downtown Olomouc.
Footage critic Although the assailant tried to escape, they caused clemency and cuts, which necessitated treatment in hospital and further treatment, the fiancee's spokeswoman, Marie Štrbáková, said.
Both obvious offenders were detained immediately after the attack.
The prosecutor filed a motion for a trial on their custody and the court upheld him on Friday.
Both men face three or ten years in prison.
Police have charged two detainees from assaulting a 35-year-old man in the centre of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attackers caused a cut and cut injuries, the man ended up in hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people, which happened on Tuesday at noon on the Grade of Liberty, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, St. Louis County Police Department spokeswoman said.
A stampede between two families took place in the area of the garden before the bar of the track in the immediate vicinity of the centre of Olomouc.
After an aggressive word, they attacked two attackers using a knife and a machete of a five-year-old man.
Although the assailant tried to escape, they caused cuts and cuts that required hospital treatment and further treatment, a police spokeswoman said.
In a skirmish that woke the city centre with great attention and for which several police patrols and officers had to intervene on the scene, it was a family dispute.
A 26-year-old man from Slovakia and a seven-year-old man from Olomouc have been charged with attempted grievous bodily harm and riots.
The prosecutor filed a motion for a trial on their custody and the court upheld it on Friday, she added.
The machete was used in the centre of Olomouc in a mass battle of the attackers also five years ago, it happened just a few dozen metres further, ahead of the dismal Varna in Riegrove Street.
Officers then said that a group of about ten foreigners with guns attacked guests of the company who were standing in front of the entrance.
According to police, they had knives, sticks and machetes.
The court then punished the two attacking strangers with a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the centre of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you walk around them every day.
One of the most blatant examples of the unused and empty house is the vast building of the former IPB building in the middle of Sen. Square.
It was supposed to be a hotel long ago.
But still nothing.
That it needs to be built in the metropolis of new and new apartments and offices?
And what about using the existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Directly in the centre of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square is several apartment buildings that, despite their location, size and often memorial protection only wail and lay empty.
We have selected the properties in the centre of the project by the Emprigible Project, which charts the long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually the victims of their owners "financial problems, opaque relationships between firms, or one of the state that can't or won't get rid of them.
Empty houses are more than homeless in the Czech Republic.

Mr. and Mrs. Clinton earned $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to disclose his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-President Bill Clinton earned $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars have been given to Clinton for charity.
Most of Clinton's income - over $6 million - is for their speeches.
Trump rejects his tax returns.
A US Democrat candidate for the presidency of Hillary Clinton on Friday published her tax statements, raising the pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-President Bill Clinton earned $10.6 million last year, the agency said.
Most of Clinton's income - over $6 million - is for their speeches, largely from the period before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign before the election.
The tax report showed that Mr and Mrs Clinton took a federal income tax rate of 34.2 per cent last year, and then the income tax at state and local level at nine per cent.
In total, they paid 43.2 per cent of income in taxes.
But Trump has a problem with a similar step, and he has not yet committed to publication of the tax return.
There's a possibility that Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all, she wrote Clinton on Twitter a few minutes after the publication of her confession.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to the secrecy surrounding Trump's revenue, including to raise doubts whether her rival is actually as rich as she claims, the agency said.
Trump's fortune is estimated to be worth billions of dollars.

In Nigeria, polio has erupted again.
The Islamists of Boko Haram have defended consistent vaccinations and doctors killed.
In Nigeria, polio cases have re-emerged.
In the northeast of the country, the government has declared extraordinary vaccinations, as the two children infected with this disease have become paralyzed.
The vaccines brought down the helicopters there.
In the hit region, Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram, who defended the vaccinations and doctors even killed.
According to the World Health Organization-LRB- WHO-RRB, the virus has been circulating unnoticed.
In the north-east, Nigeria will begin to vaccinate children against polio because there are two children infected with this disease.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has reported that a million children will be vaccinated in the state of Borno, and another four million in the states surrounding it.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday, according to the agency, quickly brought vaccines against the children's obstetrics to the affected northeastern part of the country where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram are active.
The World Health Organization - LRB- WHO - RRB- said the virus had been circulating in the area for many years.
In the past, extremists from Boko Haram have defended vaccinations and doctors even killed.
Their attacks also on Thursday made it impossible for doctors to reach areas where children with polio were found.
The two affected toddlers have come up with refugees from parts of Nigeria's newly liberated from Boko Haram.
The director of the WHO section responsible for eradicating polio Michel Zaffran told the BBC that vaccination in Nigeria would begin next week.
In Borno's long-run Islamic radical group Boko Haram.
The area has been made available to international organizations and the government until early this year, when Boko Haram has managed to weaken it in this part of the country.
Nigeria's health minister, Isaac Adewole, has admitted that new cases of polio have been a major disappointment for the country, as Nigeria wanted to announce next year that the polio had been eradicated in it.
The WHO noted that it was possible that although the disease did not occur for two years, it nonetheless spread among the children.
Children aged within five years will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, half of all cases of polio in the world accounted for Nigeria.
Whereas, in 1988, polio was still in 125 countries, it now persists in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan, and in the north of Nigeria.
The Pope met ex-prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the tortured stories of the fallen women.
Pope Francis met 20 former prostitutes who escaped from a gang of pimps.
The Pope has heard their hard-life stories and told them to look into the future with confidence.
Francis wanted to bring this meeting to human trafficking and call for increased fighting against him.
Pope Francis met twenty former prostitutes in Rome that police freed from the power of a gang of pimps.
The head of the Catholic Church for more than an hour listened to the tortured stories of fallen women and then called them to look into the future, a spokesman for the Vatican said.
Among the former prostitutes that Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria, and after one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All were subjected to cruel physical violence by the Vatican during forced prostitution.
The visit wanted Francis to draw attention to human trafficking and call for increased fighting against him, the Pope's spokesman said.
Francis often draws attention to the fates of people on the margins of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived at the Vatican in April and in June due to his personal invitation.
France will strike at the jihadists' plants.
But it won't do without the help of the Muslims.
France is Muslims themselves in the fight against radical Islamism.
In addition, Prime Minister Manuel Vallse's government is making major changes to the functioning of mosques as well as the education of the clergy.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayers.
And others will follow, the interior minister has announced.
There are over a hundred factories of jihadists in the country.
Deeply flawed If Muslims are not going to help the state in the fight against those who distort public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this religion of freedom, defender 'declared Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
It is intended, in particular, to show only imams who have been educated in France in mosques and prayers.
At the same time, he wants to stop the funding of mosques from abroad.
At the moment, it comes from abroad about 20 per cent of the money to build new mosques, the most from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
This, too, is being put in place by preachers who can distribute radicalism in France.
Deeply flawed Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy, the prime minister added.
The key to deliver these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between a secular state and a Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The country now features the French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then-prime minister Dominique de Villepin.
By then, the foundation had contributed to transparent financial flows between mosques and countries that finance their construction.
But internal divisions and rivalries soon intervened.
Verdict Reveals It's a total failure, defender 'noted recently Valls.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, a debate has erupted about a new institution that will replace the failed foundation.
All have precipitated more terrorist attacks in France, which were carried out by radicalised Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently heard that the new foundation will emerge this October.
It will have two major challenges - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to oversee the imams.
For now, it is unclear where it will take money not only to build new mosques, but also of various education centers.
But several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on halal food.
Here, in practice, the sellers of halal food would pay for certification.
Some of that money would then go to the foundation.
The contribution of ten to twenty euros -LRB- 270 to 540 kronor-RRB- would then be able to pay French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, there are about 30,000 on the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not just that.
According to the prime minister, in the mosques in the future, only preachers who passed special education programs at French universities should operate.
This should ensure that sermons are in line with democracy.
We close the radical mosque.
The French government is simultaneously in a campaign against the militants.
And others will follow, the Home Secretary announced recently.
In France, there is no place for those who preach hatred in mosques and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
In the country, estimates operate about 2500 mosques and prayers.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, authorities have hosted about 80 imams and are considering it in several other dozen.
But not everyone thinks that governments "actions can significantly interfere with radicalism.
Those who want to radicalise will do so anyway.
It doesn't happen in mosques, young people are radicalised on the internet, said Severine Labat, an expert from the National Center for Scientific Research.
Dracula Kelemen lost in the first-round sprint with star Baugovoi.
For the eight-finals, the Czech track cycling must fight in the appeals process.
Track cyclist Paul Kelemen at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, after a sprint qualification among the top eighteen, lost a duel with French great Grégorym Baugovoi, an advocate of silver from past games in London.
The procedure for the eight finals must be fought in appeals.
At the start of the royal discipline on the runway, 27 riders were built, and the best Czech wire-maker was now credited with the 14-year-old's best time.
Two hundred with a flying start in 9.969 seconds.
At the main knock-out stage, he was waiting for him to qualify for the fifth Baugé, who already had Ria bronze in the team sprint.
The Kelemen touched the veteran Frenchman in the end, but he regarded the procedure.
A great performance was flashed by defence lawyer Jason Kenny.
The 28-year-old Brit pulled out the third fastest two-hundred history and qualification wins in the Olympic record 9,551.
He also easily consulted with the last of the progressives, who was the German Maximilian Levy.
There was also a British quartet in the build-up with Bradley Wiggins, who took a new world record of 3: 50,570 and advanced to the finals.
The past-LRB- 3: 51,659 -RRB-, which Britons belonged four years since the London Olympics, improved for more than a second.
Young doctors pushing: Want a fresh wind in the field
Representatives of the young doctors met to approve new steps in their dispute over a new contract.
The Council of Young Physicians - LRB- JDC -RRB- at the British Medical Association - LRB- BMA -RRB- must ask the entire council to support more disciplinary action from the start of September.
JDC says ministers have failed to resolve questions about the contract.
Young doctors and medical students in July voted to reject the contract agreed with the BMA.
58% of its members, who participated in the election, were rejected.
In a letter to members published Thursday night on Twitter, chairwoman JDC Ellen McCourt said the government remained Singaporean continues to quietly quiz 'on questions, which Veldo to dismiss the contract.
She said: Pioneering In this light, the executive branch of the JDC vote decided to reject the proposed new contract altogether and request new formal negotiations on all matters.
In response to silence on the part of the government today, the executive board of JDC formally asked for a special meeting of the BMA's advice to approve a running program of rampant disciplinary action from the beginning of September.
The dispute led young doctors to announce in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the NHS.
The leader of young doctors at the BMA, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following a decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which the BMA recommended.
Members of the BMA at the meetings before the vote before 54,000 young doctors and medical students said the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the health minister said the contract would be a burden on the media in England.
Russia and Turkey: Alliance Raises Implicable Killings?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
Leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce a formal end to eight months of long verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counter in the sumptuous lobby of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted more of that reconciliation.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin was not smiling and barely radiated warmth, even by his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken of his tearful precious friend impersonating Mr Putin - five times, as one of the reports says.
I didn't count.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to its pre-crisis level, but they will be even better.
Another day one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan had acted as if nothing had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm showed the exact opposite.
But the lingering cold that emanated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: The interception of Russian combat aircraft by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction then was fierce.
Putin brandished the wounds around him and Ankara accused of making Moscow stab a knife in the back.
The outrage was more likely to come from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
State-controlled media for months ran a massive full-scale campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly it looked like the Turks could do it for everything.
More serious was the charge from senior state officials about Erdogan's own family to benefit from an illegal trade in oil in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strenuously denied this.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting occurred only because Putin had received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared such a victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
In the first place, Erdogan was almost stripped of power during a failed coup last month, and therefore needs all his friends.
Turkey's repeated terrorist attacks have also visibly shaken it.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have had a tough impact - especially the cancellation of charter flights that carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
That number has fallen by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly breathe a sigh of relief when it comes to resuming flights.
They make for Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey were allowed again.
Colombian comedian Turists there, tomatoes back here, texting 'how it spelled out a message in the paper Vedemosti.
But the visit had more political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it regards as a weak response to a coup attempt.
In addition, long-standing hostility to lengthy EU accession talks and the entry of Putin - who is eager for a cooling-off and to sever the ties of Turkey with the West.
The Russian leader certainly earned bonus points when Ankara asked him to help elected authorities after an attempted coup.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of regime change, it is a given.
So the summit in this pompous, coastal palace of Russia and Turkey has allowed me to demonstrate what one of the analysts described to me as a Singaporean alliance of unparalleled giveaways: As they combine the forces of two countries that feel rejected and used by the West.
But, despite publicly showing mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow has recently been opposed to the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
One could say that after nearly three-hour oral talks, the two presidents at the press conference said they did not mention the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately asked the question about the differences between them, while Putin chose to highlight those differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis that both states could find common ground on Syria.
But, after months of open enmity - and given the risk of a complete disaster when a NATO member has shot down a Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders will at least talk again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS brand is to be repressed into the role of back office.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that RBS's brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
Of them, she left when she almost died eight years ago and had to be bailed out of debt.
At the time, the strategic brands used Singaporean RBS giveaways to protect other brands of consumer finance.
They were worth millions of pounds issued for sponsorship of international sport, from the rugby championship Six Nations to champion Winblehouse Andy Marraye.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more prominence to national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers but will not run new business.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of headquarters and coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
A sign of Ulster Bank is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will get more to the fore - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt Lt. Military Bank.
During trips to customers and staff in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered questions from Ross McEwan.
BBC Scotland spokesman said: Broadcaster Marks RBS will stop being our investor brand and the brand for which our staff work because we are now much more of a bank of brands. .'
Because the bank itself has become a global brand, it has become a global brand as well as RBS.
I now say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts focused on the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities, and our workers will work under these brands.
RBS has already said it will not continue its sponsorship of Champion Six Nations, staging a profile of individual brands sponsoring the sport.
Impersonating Nasta has been a good time for us to move on to the bank of brands, because the basic question - LRB- which we are asking - is, how do we focus on becoming a better bank for customers? The TaxPayers' CEO said.
Three years ago, it would be very cynical if we said we would become a great bank for customers and they introduced the brands.
But along with the way we focused on customer needs, and not on our own, I think there are lots of changes.
I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on Horse Predilection led to the 3000th winner
Dettori cuts champagne after double victory in Newmarket made 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured a 3000th victory in the UK in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone reached his second victory of the evening on his local track - on a horse Predilection trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who achieved such an outcome in the rover's racing.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion begging Dettori, who previously won on horse Ghayyar, said:
I'm very touched because my family is here too
I am extremely pleased that this has occurred in Newmarket because I have anchored here 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's Friday night on the ground with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and I am very grateful.
Dettori picks up congratulations as he brings Predilection after victory
The two jockeys of this milestone have been achieved in obstacle racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and the 20-times champion retired Sir Anthony McCoy, who has led to the goals of more than 4,300 winners during his career-breaking record.
Lester Piggott, nine-time winner of Derby, 4 493 winners in his career
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it's no surprise that he achieved a milestone that only a few riders had achieved before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical fightback that distinguishes him from the other riders in the weigh-in.
He is a fantastic ambassador of racing, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he didn't just go on weekends and big racing, he'd already have 6,000 winners!
But the truth is that Frankie rode the winner in the UK for a bigger part of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He has a lively nature, which is good for British racing sport, but more importantly he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrates his success with his legendary flying season
From a flight of finishers to flyhalf jumps - Frankie Dettori has been a messenger of British equatorial racing for two decades.
It was like riding a roller coaster.
He has not survived the number of winners of the big races, including his well-known fiancee of the magnificent sedans "in Ascota, but he also survived a plane crash and had a ban on takeoff due to drugs.
Three years ago, he first stagnated when he returned after a 6-month ban for takeoff, but demonstrated incredible internal strength and all doubters despite having returned in the best form.
And it may not be the last time - Dettori has previously said he would like to continue racing at least until 50.
Russian President Putin has dismissed the head of the presidential office of Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov from the post of the head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest aides for many years.
The 60-year-old Ivanov has been appointed special representative for ecology and transport.
In a statement from the Kremlin, Putin's defender released Ivanov from his service to the head of the Russian presidential office, but was not given a reason.
His site will be taken over by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's representative since 2012.
The 24-year-old Vajno was previously a diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow-LRB- MGIMO-RRB- and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
On the website -LRB- in Russian-RRB-, it states that he later did the head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
On the appointment of Putin, he said: "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the administration's most important role is to support your activities of the head of state within the meaning of the draft laws and to control the extent to which your instructions are followed.
On Friday, Putin told a Russian television station that Ivanov had asked him to be released from the post and recommended that he be replaced by Vajno.
Will she convince the smiles?
This move completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest associates and, just as Putin worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast by state television, the two men declared that he was leaving the post of the head of the presidential office at his own request.
But the smiles to the cameras convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary election.
So is this the result of some struggle for power?
Nobody knows that yet.
But the official claim that the man, who was once thought of as a possible president, yearns to lead Russia's environmental policy, was met with great disbelief.
On the Kremlin's website, the remarks determined by Putin in which Ivanov puts it: Chilling Reveals It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to give me this very challenging post, you could even tell a problematic post, he confided in four years.
Apparently, I was the head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov assumed the post in December 2011.
He had been a deputy prime minister and defence minister before.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the national security committee - LRB- KGB -RRB-.
In the late 1990 "s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation - the FSB - RRB- that replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he appointed Ivanov one of his five closest aides.
His time was even speculating that Ivanov could become a successor to Putin at the head of the state after his second term, because the third period would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken over by Putin's associate, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency a mere three-and-a-half years later.
Thomas Gibson, star of the Mystery Crime series, was released after being hit by a director
Gibson was involved in a physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
Television stations ABC and CBS, which produce the series, have announced in a joint release of its release.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before the announcement.
There have been creative differences on the scene and I don't agree.
I am sorry that this has occurred, Singaporeans said in a statement.
According to a statement from television stations, ABC and CBS are details of the way the character Gibson disappears from the series following the story of a team of FBI agents, a little later.
The 24-year-old actor, who has celebrated the lead roles in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has performed in the series since the first series in 2005.
Sincerely, I love the Myshlenians of the criminal and have been giving heart and soul to them over the last 12 years, the defender 'said Gibson in his statement he issued on Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end, but that won't be possible.
I would like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show could have hoped for.
The return of the series to the 12th series is expected on September 28.
In the city of Banff mysteriously landed in the garden of the fish
A man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that occurred in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish may be the sand eel that left the water sprinters there.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, on channel Periscope has published a short film of his finding in the home that anyone could help explain how about the 5centimetre fish in his garden had been given.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects with Fife
The project at £1.35 billion is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have linked the northern platform and the Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct - the bridge now connects with Fife.
So this is the first of the four caps between Singaporean fans of the platform, which are now almost completed around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now a long 600 metres and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of iron and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 covenants.
The project for £1.35 billion is due to be completed by May 2017.
The economic secretary, Keith Brown, visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: Chilling transcript This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of building the Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we are all seeing how construction engineers have used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge on an impressive scale.
Despite the massive dimensions and mass of the bridge, the completion of the gap between the viaduct and the bridge of the delicate operation, which required extraordinary precision.
There is now a total of more than 79% of the total area of the bridge, concrete for the last part of the platform is now departing in Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to highlight the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: Scoring scoring The first deadline in the building of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this curtain represents the tip of the ground building.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the North Tower expansion platform, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the northern approach viaduct 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and highly delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is long 222 metres, weighs about 6,000 tons and it was necessary to drag it up with a rise of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerance that the team worked with was very small - only a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are Singaporeans happy to be alive left'
Three men are Singaporeans happy to be alive the squid 'after being washed away by water from their fishing boat at Anglesey.
Station lifeboats Moelfre RNLI declared the alarm on Friday at 13: 20 of the British summer time after the crew saw the incident at the Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety while their boat continued unsteadily.
Sneak peek We saw their boat circling in their vicinity and we thought the worst, scoring 'said the helmsman of the rescue boat Moelfre Vince Jones.
Fortunately, the strong wind blew it away from them before we left, scoring.
Two men rescued by a local fishing boat, a third man aged 60, was found without a life vest exhausted as it holds the buoys.
They were all handed aboard a coastal rescue boat and taken back to the station's lifeboats
Jones said: Surgeon Threatens Three men toppled into the water are happy to be alive and completely uninjured.
The engine of the ship had a line for an emergency shutdown, but somehow there was its disconnect from the person who was driving the boat when it was overturned.
Someone above those guys was holding a protective hand.
The judge refuses to settle the case for Fatal's wife.
Peter Founder is one of three MPs who should have been given the blame by Prime Minister Neeld and his senior cabinet chief, Jany Nagy's political travails, a lucrative post for a political concession.
In 2012, it was the approval of the tax package.
Shnaker, Fuksa and the Fat Man made it possible for his resignation.
Then they appeared on the influential posts in state-owned firms.
They also faced suspicion of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
But they did not, according to the court, and received a total of nearly $2 million in compensation.
The sufferer is now in bail as a witness, following the Supreme Court's intervention.
His wife works in a court building in the Fruit Market and is dealing with civil disputes.
Still, he wants to be judge Helen King's cautious -LRB- deal with criminal matters - an RRB - and avoid possible objections.
The case appears to be in charge of another Prague district court.
In doing so, the King has twice acquitted Jane Neeld, formerly Nagy.
It was alleged misuse of military intelligence to monitor first wife Prime Minister Neil Radka.
In this case, the Fat Man didn't feature.
But, according to the lawyer, Jaroslava Ortman, it is an unnecessarily exaggerated response.
I don't think impartiality can be interpreted that way for the court to rule out if witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid there's nothing to judge at all, he noted for the diary.
Sneak peek It's going to fly away from me, texting 'he added.
Roman Bocek, a former official, is also charged in the case of political travails.
But according to his lawyer, Peter Tomana, the eventual objection would have a chance of success.
The Circuit Court of Practice 1 was discussed on June 13 by the former head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Peter Neil Nagy-LRB- today non-time-RRB- and others charged in the bail-out of Military Intelligence.
In the picture, Neave and her husband come to court.
The Fat Man was supposed to be dealing with the Prophets.
For example, the wife of an ex-member should judge the statements of President Milosevic of the Democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutic.
Zeman said he sympathized with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is dead!
The girl appears to have died in an air raid by Allied forces.
He and his two same old girlfriends flew to Syria last February from London's Gatwick airport.
The British Interior Ministry did not comment on her death.
Young Londoners who escaped from the home were secretly taken to Syria via the Turkish border, according to police.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abaz and Kadiza Sultanao head to the media for their next former classmate at the London School of Bethnal Green Academy.
The case last year caused a huge wave of attention and also tensions in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that about 600 British Muslims have traveled to Syria so far, from about 50 young women and girls.
Many of them have joined the militants from IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
A dream job for a hundred-dollar salary.
Great-paying jobs you don't even need college for.
So he looks at first sight of the work of an I.T. guy.
And often the latter.
In fact, the advantage is not only at Czech's extremely high salary -LRB- in Prague, you earn up to £180 - RRB-, but also extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge lack of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
There are an estimated nearly 20,000 IT specialists in the Czech Republic.
Among the most wanted, according to statistics agency, Grafton programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between a few offers of work.
So they don't compete for jobs, but job positions on candidates, commenting Jitka Souths, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
College education is not a necessity for I.T. people.
Higher education means a good foundation and is an overall indicator of the intelligence and education of a candidate, but does not often have much to do with knowledge of development.
Developers have to keep learning new things, which one studied high school will not replace, says Peter Kubaka, director of the Monster Career CZ.
He will make the most of it in Prague.
Premier League wages are all moving high above the Republican average.
The most money will come in Prague and Brno, in the regions that are not such a hit.
Chilling Glimpse The conditions in Brno are comparable to those of the Prague, Singaporeans confirms Kubaka.
The tech directors will reach the highest earnings.
In Prague and Brno, they can come to £120,000 - £180.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it will not fall below $80,000.
The Demons are also IT project managers.
At boarding, they can earn 60,000 - $100,000.
The fight is also about graduates.
While in some professions, alumni often have to go straight to the Labor government, not paying for the ayouns.
For companies to drag and switch from another company, they would like to reach out to the graduate.
They can raise it according to their own.
They won't budge without language.
Knowledge of foreign language is useful in every profession, but at least a decent English is essential.
The knowledge of at least one foreign language is a necessity for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we meet a number of cases where companies are looking for, in particular, professionally educated and experienced, and content only with the average knowledge of English.
But if, for example, the aid worker controls more foreign language, he is interesting to his employer because he can service more customers from different countries, adds the director of Cuba.
In Google, it's paradise.
They can only be quietly envied by Czech workers at Google.
Of course, there is a flexible working time for them, the ability to work from home or a variety of abbreviations, not just for moms.
Fewer Singaporean dads are given the company four weeks of leave extra after the birth of the baby, the comedian 'says Martin Jones, a Google spokesperson.
Pampering includes health care for workers and family, catering, transportation, training, wellness or massage directly in the workplace.
Who wants to educate, has the green, and it doesn't matter what the new wants to learn.
But that does not stop the benefits.
Such a full fridge is also certainly not to be discarded.
A healthy lunch - LRB- in some locations as well as breakfast and dinner - RRB- is available in place every day.
In addition, they are in all the offices of the so-called micro kitchens, where people always find a healthy snack, a spokesperson reveals.
And for nothing to be thrown out, what's not to eat is to put in boxes that employees can take home the night before.
And the reason for the Czech situation of incredible benefits?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
For Google, it's not important for employees to sit in the office for eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shift or development, ideas and innovative solutions, texting 'adds a spokesperson.
The UN has sharply criticized Bulgaria for the criminalisation of refugees.
Zeid Rabolaad al-Hussein, the UN's human rights commissioner, accused Bulgaria of systematically violating the human rights of criminalising refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government apologised is causing serious concern that Bulgaria does not respect international law enforcement, warned Zeid Rajoy ad al-Hussein in a statement.
He pointed out that the scoring spree was particularly worrying to be a witness to how important and influential public figures express public support for the criminal-armed fighting, which drilled them by hunting for refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey.
Deeply flawed One of the most serious problems is that almost all of the people who switch to Bulgarian territory in a non-regular way are automatically arrested, the defender 'pointed out by Zeid.
Worse - often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they attempt to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalised despite the fact that everyone has the right to leave any country under international law, including their own.
Bulgaria detained 14,000 migrants this year, last year for the same period of 21,000.
Pokémon Go - a chase for health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to see how the world is changing.
A number of people have lamented over the past decade that teenagers and children are no longer playing outside and prefer to spend free time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people off the sofa and leads them to activity.
Time spent in front of screens was initially spruced on TV, later on video games and the latest on smart phones.
It's great to see that the technology and activities out there are not going to exclude themselves.
I'm speaking, of course, a fashion that is Pokémon Go, an application based on the characters that first appeared in video games in the late '90s -LRB- later created a cartoon, playing cards and more -RRB-.
As with many cultural phenomena, this has occurred before the launch of this new game at the beginning of July in the US, Australia, and New Zealand to drop interest.
The listing in other countries has then been postponed because of the massive interest it has led to overloading the servers.
Pokémon Go acquired more users over a few days than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter.
How does that work?
In short, players on the smart phone go out looking for Pokémon, which they follow through GPS, and when they find them, they can be plagued by photocopies' -LRB- despite a screenshot on the phone -RRB- or the left.'
Mania is engulfed in a generation that has played in the younger age, lifting it out of its seat and driving it out to seek Pokémon.
In the US thanks to this game, there has been a significant increase in the number of steps that Singaporeans the average pup 'man will do every day.
The Cardiogram, for a smart watch from Apple, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of running the game, the number of people watching each day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information on who Pokémon Go plays - seeing only crude data on levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns seeking to make people speechless by finding the 30 giveaways, Singaporeans picked up from the couch kangaroo, and Singaporeans were active every day of the spree 'fell on barren land, because most of the message aimed at public health is boring and designed to people who don't look good.
Yet the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that we cannot place here.
But the beauty of the game Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunlight.
Some people even get new friends in the hunt for the pokies.
As it is, there are, of course, those who seek any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can walk in the door.
And what, like?
There's been a breakthrough.
In its time of application for smart phones, such as Fitbit, they were supposed to track our activity, but didn't give us a reason to do anything like that at this game.
The news flash and interest will begin to fade at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, there will be more games to combine apps and virtual reality with activity in the real world and will help a number of people in the hunt for activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles has won gold in the multitasking of women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump.
Effortlessly on the stick.
They were all speechless.
Excellent at everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast went straight for the title in a multifight on Thursday, and others on the full line under the Olympic spotlight surfaced.
The total result of 62,198 clearly confirmed her head-on in front of a silver medalist and a member of the team's Singaporean final five of the Singaporeans' Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafinova.
Simone Biles-LRB- US-RRB- Thursday during an appearance on the cladding at the final of a multi-match of individuals in a sports gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro.
Biles became the fourth American in a row who won a multi-fight, and fifth overall when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and possibly the best at all.
When her overall finals assessment was on the board and her long journey to this point ended, there were tears on her face.
This success puts her in the same league of isolated athletes of her time, such as Michael Phelps, who delivered a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, won 15 medals at the world championships - including 10 gold. Her fascinating reports are a mixture of ambition and accuracy, and the 1984 Mary Lou Retton, she called it the coolest best gymnast ever seen.
The final test was in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the race, but between her and herself and the burden of too much expectation.
Anything but a return home to his family in Spring in Texas with a hand full of gold medals would be perceived as disappointing.
Simone Biles-LRB- US-RRB-, left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning the gold and silver medal in the final of the female multi-group single women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
First Biles won Tuesday, when she was as an exclamation mark in the celebration of outgoing national team co-ordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists she never looked forward during her long journey to the top, which is not entirely true.
Part of her report in the simple - the one that contains a typical triple-double turnover for her - is set in Latin music, which would just be thrown home, into the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and her talent discovered mother trainer Aimee Boorman on the way to the gym where Boorman trained and where he gained strength.
The competition in the multi-state has not lost since the summer of 2013 - that's a sequence of victories that can go on as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafino took the lead with two turns, it was an illusion.
The stick and the simple - where Biles is defending the world championships - are waiting.
She got back to the front with 15,433 points per stick - and she dismissed with 15,933 points in the prostate.
Raisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final score - mere formality - and around a glittering red, white and blue shadows, Biles appeared to have tears as she fulfilled the wishes she had once made in the diary.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she was sharing a third straight with Mustafi, but then bronze for the sum of the three best reports.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team that the Americans call the coolest grandma hooker 'was pretty much up front.
After her simple sending a crowd of aerial kisses, she was overcome by a return that sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles, he has a contribution that this 19-year-old athlete placed on Twitter this week, where he became a complete hit, a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
According to a police report published on Thursday, two women and a girl aged 12 were killed during the most serious attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix, were shot while sitting in the car, chatting and listening to music.
Authorities reported that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and daughter Ellis Maleah were shot on June 12 in a car parked in the driveway.
The report said the armed man stood on the passenger side and fired eight shots from a handgun, then fled in another vehicle.
According to police, they are not worth a triple murder, because the attacker didn't take the wallet, nor the amount of $2,900 that one of the adult victims had.
A spokesman for the police in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said investigators were investigating whether the shooting had any connection to some of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, there were nine attacks in four months, in which seven people were killed and two other people were injured.
Footage uploaded It's in the villa area before the Houses of Auctions, Howard said earlier this month for a branch of KPHO's CBS affiliate.
Police believe the suspect was using several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late '90s, a black BMW from the late' 90s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to reveal what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis-LRB- 33-RRB- was taken to a hospital where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner-LRB- 31-RRB- and daughter Ellis Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, the target of which became an empty van just half an hour before the triple murder, police believe that the killer was the serial killer.
Investigators found the shell casings and the bullet fragments in the seat and the bullet came from under the hood of the engine.
Mother of six-year-old baby with microcephalitis: Surgeon 'His condition improves responsible'
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike her peers, they suffer from microcephalitis, which is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, I first thought I couldn't handle this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you're ready for that, hooker 'she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, have learned that Edmund may never know them and may not survive.
Some doctors have even suggested he be placed in a constitution.
Verdict Reveals My first reaction was that I thought that this was not going to be a giveaway today, explains Picciutz.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Until the age of three, he couldn't sit or crawl.
But some milestones are already filling up.
He comes with help and rides his bike.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth prefers a sign language, using which Edmund says tearfuls please, sing to me.'
Celebrities apologised to make him a sign language critic, "Picciut told CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - he says Edmund invented some of the characters himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different states: Genetic, as in the case of Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can differ materially.
It is too early to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of the infected.
Picciutz recalls the emotional toll that an uncertain future chooses.
I'm constantly asking: Responsible.'
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I've never asked what the overall prognosis is, because I don't expect anyone to tell me that at all.
But Picciuto has an encouraging message for mothers of all children suffering from congenital defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
Know that it will be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and flooding took rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana arrived on Friday by the governor to declare an emergency. More rain is expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service - LRB- NWS -RRB- reported that, after extreme downturns, a number of rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi spill out of their shores and face extensive flooding.
Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, said state officials are constantly in contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's office for national security and preparedness for emergencies, said they were getting requests for vehicles for driving in water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said only precinct Tangipahoa asked for ten thousand sandbags.
Flood watch will remain in most southern Louisiana to work until Saturday.
The weather service said in a statement that it could rain an additional 8 to 13 centimetres over the sea.
In southern Alabama, the flood watch was on standby on Friday, when rain continued in the city of Mobile.
According to the forecast, the River Comite at Baton Rouge and Amite at Denham Springs will culminate at the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both said they could flood a number of houses in the suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He also said that the dangers were flooding downstream in the Ascension precinct, when these flooded flows would only take slowly to the Lake Maurepas.

Hansford said emergency workers had rescued all three huge trucks in military style and took them to a fire station in Gloster, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that, with the continuation of heavy rains, the flooding giveaways quickly spread havoc 'and authorities are considering the evacuation.
According to Krautmann, the Observer near Livinston announced that 35 centimetres of rain precipitation had fallen from midnight to Friday through Friday morning.
Krautmann said the land has been heavily soaked since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rain and paid trips had taken rescue residents from their homes in the Tangipahoa district and the cancellation of teaching in five school districts.

Mahaj Brown -LRB- 6 -RRB- - Threatened boy blasted as he cuts a prank ', survived shooting in Philadelphia
According to police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia.
The baby's grandparents identified it as Mahais Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
Grandparents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including groin, legs, arms and abdomen, but was conscious while travelling to the hospital.
Explaining to Schytal the awful lot, his little body was shot down like a cut, the kangaroo told the station his grandmother, Delores Melendez.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in a critical condition in hospital and underwent several operations.
The family told the station that the boy should be healed.
He was supposed to enter the first class of primary school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people who have been shot in part of Germantown.
The gunman was yet another three men: Two aged 29 and one aged 32.
One of the men aged 29 is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, two more victims in a stable condition.
According to reports of the station, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle, along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car and police are examining whether any of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there was likely to be a gunfight between several armed men.
Shell casings were found on the spot, belonging to various assault weapons.
Apparently, it was certainly an ongoing battle.
There were shells on either side of the sidewalk.
So it appears there were a couple of armed fighting people who were actively involved, the paramedics said for the station captain of Philadelphia Police Anthony Ginaldi.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one has been detained and police are reportedly exploring video games from the cameras.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray shot on Tuesday in front of the house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
The girl is recovering and police are still looking for the suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I imagine a female team of gymnasts for this year's Olympic Games, for several reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And for the other: There are three gymnasts in this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren comedian Laurie Furnish 'Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team that complements Aly Raisman, who is Jewish ancestry, and Catholic Madison Kociano.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also cemented the presence of black and Latin Americans at the top of this sport.
Gymnast number one in the past four years has been African-American.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second rung last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougales surprisingly became the champion of the Olympic Games and America cheered.
Now the world could have witnessed the incredible feat of triple world winner Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who outperformed the unexpected but mistrustful gymnast figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in the women's multitasking of individuals.
And a member of Aly Raisman's team won the silver.
We are witnessing the sport's peak, but in the hours of gymnastics in the country, it doesn't look like that.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the same trip to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are scoring the final five fours' because a team gymnast at the next Olympic Games will be composed only of four athletes, and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi is training.
But the fact is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport, and gymnastics are trained largely in private gymnastics clubs that keep parents who pay the costs of training, equipment, travel, dressings, competition fees, hotel accommodation - LRB- for coaches and their confederations and families - RRB-. And that's far from all.
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the training, and for the families of gymnasts and gymnasts, this is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they started in gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics training, which are more accessible and accessible to the communities of countless young girls that Simone, Gabby, and Laurie have inspired.
I started the gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer gymnastics free or low-cost in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people in the city-LRB- especially black and Hispanic origins - RRB- and we've trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to the Detroit-LRB- my hometown of -RRB-, where we will provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means life benefits for good health, achievements at school and at work.
The inspiration for this team will be to send us thousands of young girls who want to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison, for showing a tearful girl's power scoring and winning the Olympic team gold, and thank you for motivating so many young girls of all origins to make the journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter more strikes
Ministers had hoped that following the closure of the revised contract, representatives of the British Medical Association - LRB- BMA -RRB- would end disagreements on the changes, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who attended the elections rejected the contract.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to enforce the contract with the NHS being in a Singaporean country of nobody's cause, and further delays would have a damaging effect on staff and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in nighttime and weekend working practices to improve care in the non-social hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's Young Physician's Office in a statement last night said: Broadcaster Mladi doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that there will be an increase in the current labour crisis and thus to fair treatment of all doctors.
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes under a new contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the disputes through negotiations have faced an unwillingness to engage Dr and often with deafening silence from the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise from last month, that possibility is still open.
Footage critic Jeremy Hunt now has to act, push for enforcement and resolve young doctors' concerns.
If this does not happen, then young doctors are ready to take the next steps.
There was a postponement of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits during the last strike at the end of April, as nurses and specialists were called in to arrest the doctors who were among the protesters.
Ministers had hoped that after the closure of the revised contract, representatives of the British Medical Association - LRB- BMA -RRB- would conclude disagreement about the changes.
The BMA wants higher payments for work over the weekend for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of the NHS employers, urged young doctors not to enter any strike.
Mortimer said: Stripping the disciplinary action will achieve little or nothing at all, but there will be pressure on already-congested teams and services and a rise in fears, exhaustion and disruption for patients, nursing staff and their families.
In the past two months, we have dealt with the advice of young doctors, and with the Department of Health and the others, we have responded positively to them about the role of supervision and informer.
Employers had hoped that continued positive involvement in other important issues - such as workload, flexibility in tuition fees, further training for those returning after the interruption of careers, the cost of training, the mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and the difference in the gender pay gap - was evidence of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health took the agreements that were reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
The cure for sixty kronor a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to use the drug, which translates to around sixty per cent -LRB- two pounds -RRB-. Authorities recommend giving it to more patients over a longer period of time.
The anti-clotting drug Ticagrelor decreases in people with heart disease risk that a seizure will occur again.
The drug is now administered after having a heart attack for 12 months to reduce the risk of stroke or another seizure.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be administered to people over a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be administered to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, a heart attack will suffer about 140 000 people every year and a quarter of them will suffer yet another seizure or heart attack.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by a build-up of fat that produces a continuous layer on the walls of the artery.
If this layer is dissected, blood clots may occur, blocking blood access to the heart and heart attack.
If the clot is released, the bloodstream can go on, blocking the blood supply to the brain and causing cerebral palsy.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of another seizure.
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by British firm AstraZeneca and which is sold under the commercial name Brilique, reduces the risk by making the precipitation less likely to occur.
In the proposal for NICE, which was published today, it is recommended that patients receive 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg, along with aspirin, twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the Centre for the Evaluation of Technology for Health NICE, said: Prostate gland Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and which affects another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences.
Fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a patient.
It is shown that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
We are delighted to be able to expand the treatment options available to many thousands of people who will benefit from it in the preliminary recommendations of the ticagrelor.
Because information about the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - above all, the risk of bleeding - over three years is limited, there is no recommended treatment over this time.
Computer culture began to flourish in Muslim areas
Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, which was linked to the government's report
A culture of political correctness has led to the neglect of spreading fraud in Muslim communities, the government report said today.
Ex- minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticises police, election inspectors and councils for ignoring abuse by voters because of obsessive hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.
The former secretary of the community, now a ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said that intimidating voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that police should make cordons and frightened voters protect themselves from the electoral rooms.
He recommended that voters take a proof of identity with them and could prove who they are at the election.
Currently voters just have to give their name and address.
The report also proposes to put indelible ink on the hands of people in handing over the voice, in order to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, says Pickles.
It asks for the press to be given greater access to documents from the meeting and to decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
Reward photography This is not only about protecting against electoral fraud, but also about protecting the local government from the wider corruption environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand, Singaporeans said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of the election scandal in Tower Hamlets in west London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled, the incumbent mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his post after allegations of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman apologised cynically hit Singaporeans' religious feelings for his Muslim community and silenced his critics accused of racist and Islamophobia.
In his words, Rahman led his campaign to be a religious obligation to devout Muslims to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes have been called into question or as a result of identity theft, when one is voting and making the appearance of someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud of the correspondence vote - which is claimed that senior members of the Muslim community have exerted pressure on people to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, on the slide, has given several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including the presentation of the identity document
In his report, the report states: Footage has been presented to show that on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, mainly women and young people, it was put pressure to vote by the will of the elders, especially in communities coming from Pakistan and Bangladesh.
Deeply concerned Vznik fears that... state institutions have been greeted in front of such behaviour because of Singaporeans politically correct 'hypersensitivity to the ethnicity of ethnicity and religion.
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including for political activists to be banned from manipulating the correspondents' votes and preventing the extortionate by heaping the votes.
The report, now assessed by Theresa May, also calls for more thorough checks on registrations to prevent the use of election lists for immigration fraud and benefits fraud.
Consider the possibility of asking voters to submit a document of identity before the vote.
Use of indelible ink on the fingers of people in the vote to prevent anyone going to vote twice.
The implementation of systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Request for an automatic correspondence vote to limit the duration of three years.
To ban political agitators and activists in order to manipulate the resignation of correspondence votes and electoral envelopes.
Giving police permission to create the cordons around the constituency.
Changing the laws to make it easier to prosecute people developing illegal pressure under the 1983 reform law.
Disable taking photos at polling stations.
Requiring only the English-LRB- except Wales-RRB- to work in the polling stations.
Strengthen training and ensure that workers follow the rule that voters go to the ballot box individually.
Sir Eric criticises the London police and says it is ludicrous by the astonishing giveaways that there have been no allegations of criminal offences following the case of Tower Hamlets.
Footage critic The Court of Elections has ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corruption and illegal practices giveaways, he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the force of evidence of a crime.
It also criticises the no-results giveaways of checkout polling booths in departments to register voters at City Hall.
Sir Eric said: Broadcaster Loony's decision to court in the Tower Hamlets wake.
Our nation has a proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of the shuffle by some authorities threaten that reputation.
The infatuation of cycling's twin Duchess Kate and other twins of well-known personalities at the Rio Olympics
The fans of the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 this week have gone mad at French cycling's Pauline Ferrandd-Prejudice, which is up to strikingly similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is by no means a single athlete seeking gold this year, which boasts its own twin from the well-known personalities - at least not according to social networks.
To celebrate the Olympic Games in Rio and all the well-known figures currently appearing on our screens, the column for women FEMAIL has set up a list of Olympians who are more than remotely similar to the Holywood celebrities.
Like the hunted game: A member of the American team archers Brady Ellison-LRB- left -RRB- has been likened to Leonard DiCaprio since he was a kid
Alongside the twin Kate on the cycling track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin-star Leonard DiCaprio.
A racer from a team of American archers, Brady Ellison, caused a backlash on Twitter after what emerged of his shots, on which he was conspicuously similar to the Wolf of Wall Street.
Brady himself noted the media frenzy, admitting that he had been hearing about his similarities with Leo since he was a kid.
Singaporeans do not see any great resemblance, except perhaps in addition to the beard, the critic 'said Brady for the Huffington Post.
Congrats He's a dude and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment.
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt be highlighted even more this year: A striking resemblance between a British jumper in the distance by Greg Rutherford and favourite actor Neil Patrick Harris.
About Russian gymnast Aliye Mustafins with her big, prominent eyes, she was said to be a copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been likened to the star of Gell Matthews Morrison for several years.
And for a change: The user thinks that Nathan has apologised to the athletic version of the comedian 'actor from the movie Origin -LRB- Inception -RRB-
Another long-term comparison is the addition of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimova boasts not just the same snowy complexion and blonde hair, as has Annalynne McCord, and about Nathan Adriano of the US team, saying she looks like a Singaporean athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt.
Proficient women: Star of Football Hope Solt -LRB- left -RRB- and actress series Dexter Jennifer Carpenter-LRB- right-RRB- have a similar shape to face and eyes
Not just one: Twitter user was delighted that the similarities were noticed by others
On the waves of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for similar in relation to couples
One Twitter user posted recently on the site has expressed its satisfaction at stripping the rest of the Internet into thinking that Hope Soli and Jennifer Carpenter are in truth identical.
Football star Hope Solve and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have a really incredibly similar shape to face and eyes.
Among the other popular comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or the holder of a gold medal for gymnast Gabby Douglas, boasting her wonderfully wide smile that seemed to replicate the smile of Gabrielle Union, the stars of the film Bravo, girls!
CBC officials' commentator apologizes for telling a Chinese swimmer 'that tearful'
Commenting on Wednesday's live transfer from the Olympic Games to the CBC, he was outraged by the analysis of the performance of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan commentator Byron MacDonald. The swimmer ended up in the fourth place of the women's race on the 4x200 m shootout in free style
Canada's CBC station was forced to apologise after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer during the race was pulled up as the smell of a kangaroo and a homemade prank blew up a dunk.
Byron MacDonald's commentator thought his microphone was turned off when, at the end of the final, the shootings of women at the 4x200-metre-free style began to garner their own views.
MacDonald, who was on the team of commentators of CBC to bring a homemade revival of giveaways, among other things he said: Tearful That little 14-year-old from China has given up, the mud.
Too much excitement, like a stink, blew up.
Thank you.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan-LRB- 14-RRB- upped the second relay race at a time of 1: 57.79 - then 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed Canadians to touch China.
The spectators in Canada began to speak quickly online and were horrified by the tone and language the commentator used
Emmett MacFarlane wrote on Twitter: Footage critic told the broadcaster on CBC that a 14-year-old swimmer from China tearfully blew up '??? Footage'???????????????????????????????????????????
The idiot didn't notice he was still in the broadcast.
Ai Yanhanova of China in the final of the women's shootout race on the 4x200-metre free style has been described as: Tearful That little 14-year-old from China has given up, the mud.
Criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came from all sides and many demanded his appeal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn't hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: Glamorous Wow # ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and it sounds like we would be a bunch of racists. # disgust.
Soon after, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC reception, apologized for the live commentary of MacDonald and said: Celebrities apologising for comment on the performance of a swimmer who escaped to broadcast.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.
CBC station eventually apologised more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to comment
Co-commentator Scott Russel had to apologise on behalf of MacDonald
The CBC then copied and placed their apology in response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The station also quickly apologised and released a statement.
She sincerely regrets that the words were spoken, not to get on the air.
We quickly apologised to our viewers in the broadcast and those watching us on social networks.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inconvenient and unfortunate choice of words, Byron is deeply sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast and attempted to explain his remark by claiming he did not want to sound like a personal attack.
Footage critic I would like to now apologise for the comment I made last night after the shootings of women, Singaporeans said in a broadcast from the Olympics to the CBC.
I was thinking of the power of a swimmer and not a person of a swimmer as such.
Footage scam Isn't the need to say I didn't have any disrespect and I'm very sorry.'
Customers in Primark outraged by a woman who shamelessly tried underwear in the middle of the store
When a woman stripped off to try her pants on a sales area in the middle of Primark, they weren't sure which way to look.
To make it even worse, she tried her size, took her panties off and put them back on the shelf.
In the viewing she went on and eventually at the store in the shopping centre of Bouverie Place in Flokestone, she tried four pairs of pants.
Store Primark in the shopping centre of Bouverie Place in Folkestone, where the woman tried her pants before returning them to the rack
Mother-of-two children Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said the mystery woman was redressed after trying out her underwear and walked out of the store without buying anything.
She said: Tearful People couldn't believe their own eyes.'
She stood in the middle of the shop, took off her panties, stripped off her own pantyhose and panties and put them on.
She didn't try to find any discreet place - just standing there, cheeky as a monkey.
Actress Reveals Everyone just stared as she undressed her pants again, and evidently didn't like them, because she's put them back in the regal.'
She did the same thing with three others before finally deciding she didn't like anything, she redressed and left.
Tearful She looked like she didn't mind who she was looking at - nor would she think of the man who might buy the pants she tried.
Miss Davidson-LRB- 33-RRB-, who lives in Kent, said: Chilling Revelation That notion of taking home a pair of pants wearing someone else and no one has cleaned them up.
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson added: Tearful While she left, I picked up the things she obviously tried to pull them off sale - what's also the only right thing.'
Explaining the footage would make me think I'd bring home a new pair of pants and find that she was wearing a different woman, took them off and that they weren't washed away.'
A spokesperson for the store Primark said: Broadcaster Primark knows about the incident, which occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9.
All of the products in question were withdrawn from sale.
How to defend against gun attack by Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com, it could be a bit safer for you.
We spoke to Rhaste Mizrach, the Grand Master of the Krav Magy Estate in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how suddenly to gain superiority over the violence, whether you're approached from the front or from behind.
If they come near you from behind, says Mizrach, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and Singaporeans have a free-to-air skid.
You will then grasp the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder just before you hit it in the face with a free elbow.
Then it follows the knee to the groin, and while the attacker is writhing in pain, you twist the gun out of his hand, hit it in the main in the face, and you start retreating, the gun you keep pointing at him.
If an armed man approaches you from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the firing line, grasp the weapon, and make sure the rogue can't shoot.
At the same time, put the force into the weapon and strike the attacker in the chest, then take the weapon out of his grasp and start retreating, still aiming at it.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video where you see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way to get out of the ambush - unless you are Grand Master Krav Maga - is to issue all the cash.
Traveller Ian Wright licking the dirtiest places in Europe into travel guide
The British traveller chose to test his immune system and gag reflex - by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Moderator and author of the cemeteries of Ian Wright-LRB- 51-RRB-, from Suffolk, on the evidence of the strength of his immune system to wear his tongue of the euro notes, railings on the Piccadilly Circus, a button to flush the toilet on a train and a Russian public phone.
Before the siege, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us into what he was embarking on.
The experiment, on the basis of which the film Lickhiker starring Guide to Inner Strength, has produced interesting results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train that has been used by thousands of other people may seem utterly repulsive, however, perhaps in the kitchen sink is in fact a lot more damaging bacteria.
Throughout his journey across Europe, Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health specialists about strengthening the bacteria's gut flora and on their own health.
Fortunately, none of what he licked in his mouth left anything worse than a taste.
Ian Wright has thrived by testing the resilience of his intestines on the roads around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission he completely safely tested his immune system - from public railings to train stations after flushing
In the film he made about it, he says: Tearful Since I was a kid, I didn't care much about my health, and I put everything in my mouth, from dirt to eating worms and muddy water.
He reaffirmed his reputation in the film.
All he refused was the dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple windshield, the luminometer showed the value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
But one public toilet in Russia licked it down after its luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy product maker Valio made the Traveler's film called The Lickhiker quiz Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the numbers of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom
In the film, he said: Tearful This is almost the most disgusting thing I've ever felt in the toilet.
Nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting.
Film Lickhiker Reveals Guide to Inner Strength was taken in collaboration with Finnish dairy products maker Valio.
Mr Wright provided Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid and vitamin C and D vitamins that help to reinforce gut bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio for snacks, dads and a new category, said: Broadcaster We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would be monitored while allowing us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've invented a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of homesickness to call Ian.
He says the concern for bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in the wider context - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of the health of the gut and how it is linked to the immune system.
Increasing interest in healthy intestine is a global phenomenon, and we have brought more detailed information through this document to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there's a great sense of humour in the film!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: Sneak peek Say it this way, Ian would have lost my respect if he licked some of what I wanted to do - like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the movie.
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, others back pretty hard.
I'm glad we licked some of those dirty things.
Valio conducted a survey in 2015, according to which 84 percent of respondents were associated with lactic acid bacteria in particular with the health of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent of respondents said that at least occasionally they use products containing added bacteria of lactic acid.
Family of the socially needed before eviction vandalized municipal building in the town of Saltash in Cornwall
The family of the socially needed left to their general house the damage of £50,000 after they were accused of terrorizing their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from the house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long line of complaints against them.
After their violent eviction from the house, housing association officials were shocked to find the property was in the emergency room.
There were holes in the walls, the floor cover was torn, garbage and walls were piled up everywhere on the floor.
Family has already moved out and is due to live in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director for housing issues in Cornwall Housing, said she was worried about whether the house would go to save.
She said: Glamorous texting For people here it was a nightmare and I don't think people should live like that.
You need to consider a number of circumstances because this property will probably fit in the consciousness as a homemade herb not until such a nice part of the squid 'Cornwall.
The family is notorious, and their names are notorious.
The couple has three sons who have been staying in the house at times, and police said the horrific thing the family was doing belonged to street battles with the use of baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug distribution and loud screams, fights and swearing.
Skeldon-LRB- 47-RRB-, whose name was listed on the lease, was awarded a penalty for anti-social behaviour in June.
In several rooms in the house that may be demolished, they were found smelling of rubbish.
In the house where drugs were distributed in the past, the floor cover was torn up
Neighbours say they saw them on the street as they were fighting, and regularly called police
Cornwall Housing and her partner were forced out of the house this week after they were given an additional period of 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
Neighbours that were relieved by the eviction were greeted with the fact that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said: Vigilante freaks didn't care at all about anyone.
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always like this.
How many times have we seen the police?
We couldn't sleep in the morning.
We stood up because there was an incredible silence - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a supervisor in the neighbourhood of Cornwall Housing, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, to the house was regularly called by police
Rubbish and old toys were lounging in an overgrown part of the municipal house
It adds: Outrage is a disgrace that the tenant has failed to accept responsibility for its own behaviour and for the behaviour of their family. The eviction is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
It was a very complex case because their behaviour was extreme and their actions, according to a witness, had to frighten its neighbours.
I respect all the work that has been done by my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and members of the local community who have bravely informed us.
I hope that this move will bring a little comfort to the neighbours and, at the same time, carry the message that we will not tolerate non-social behaviour.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of the tenants who lived in the house at different times were around 20.

Workers will now have to remove piles of rubbish left thrown around the house
In 2014, police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70 grams of hemp, weight, equipment and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possessing Class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She said the money was earmarked for the foundation of a house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is thought that Tanya and her partner after the eviction now live in private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted with graffiti.
Police say they will seek eviction by tenants who breach the rules of their rental contracts
Angela Crowe of the police of Denovo and Cornwall said the eviction was sent a clear message to the other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
Reward VERDICT This is a message to all those who think they can act with impunity, and those who would like to follow such behaviour, Singaporeans said.
The police of Denovo and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and non-social behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal terrified after low-flying military jet plane over beaches
Tourists who enjoyed the sun's rays in Portuguese Aveiro were terrified to death
The aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force P- 3C Orion flew up to an incredibly low
The military's air force said it was a training flight, and it took to ensure that there was no threat to safety
By the time the low-flying jet swooped over the filled beach, terrified tourists were engulfed in panic.
In dramatic footage, you can see the military aircraft getting to the distance almost to a touch from sunny people on a sandy beach at the city of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists have started to rise after being disturbed by the noise of the jet's engines without seeing what emerges from the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who published the video recordings of a dramatic overpass on social networks, said: Tearful Letterman flew twice really low and at one point appeared to crash.
Nuno Arroja adds: Chilling footage was surfing and I really thought the plane was going to fall on my head.
Tourists on the beach in Aveir were horrified when a plane flew low from the darkness
The Portuguese military air force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify the fishing boat off the coast and had to stand low because it was the only way to check the ship.
The aircraft reportedly flew slightly lower than usual because of poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. The Air Force, however, insists that the safety of the people has not been compromised.
Forest fires destroyed part of mainland Portugal this summer and claimed four victims of life on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese military air force today said the pilot had to fly low due to thick fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from view
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats in training.
Half the funeral services don't follow the rules.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the legislation.
The Czech Business Inspectorate -LRB- Read-RRB- that found out at the controls in the second quarter.
Funeral services do not usually inform survivors of their prices or give written confirmation of receipt of the order.
Chioi imposed 41 fines totalling $73,000 in total.
Today, her spokesman, Jiri Fröhlich, has informed her.
Inspectors found misconduct at 47 of the 95 controls.
In addition to not informing on prices and missing confirmation, some funeral services have also sold products or provided services at other prices than was agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially unverified instrument.
The inspection therefore banned the sale of 23 products for a total of £7077.
It was the cover of the urns, the candles and the vaults that were not properly marked with mandatory information.
Chilling VERDICT Given that in this particular area of services there is still a violation of the law, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year, the giveaway added Fröhlich.
London schoolgirl who joined IS has been killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, has died in Syria.
Legal counsel Tasnime Akunjee said the family had learned about her death in the Syrian Raction several weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that she was probably killed during the Russian air attack in Raction, which is a bastion of the group in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to escape from the war-stricken country and to return to Britain.
Freshman critic Man wants to believe that the only good on the whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that this is the real danger associated with the road to the war zone - is that it will deter people from when they make the decision, the defender said Akunjee.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the eastern part of London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then onto the bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana family learned that she was married to an IS fighter in Syria - and widowed within a few months.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, she will keep Garland as a Supreme Court candidate.
In the Senate for Democratic Party, Harry Reid says he is confident that a candidate for the presidential election for Democrats Hillary Clinton nominates Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in the event of his election.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, even if President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Leader of the Senate majority Mitch McConnel says the person who replaces the late Supreme Court judge will elect a future president.
Reid said during the conference call on Thursday that he thought Clinton would pick Garland's giveaway with a certain degree of trustworthiness.
Reid's spokeswoman later said he did not directly talk to Clinton about whether Garland would be nominated, and that he merely speculated.
He appreciated Garland and said that the Clinton team's choice of someone else would not want to cater to the hooker.
Garland is chairman of the federal appeals court in Washington.
Reid said that the Republicans, who block Garland's appointment, are Singaporeans of the Singaporeans "and a Singaporean wannabe Republican candidate for the presidency of Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
According to the Magazine of Treats, there are naked calendars for Singaporean women as well as for men father'
The Treats magazine is working closely with photographer David Bellemer on the release of the calendar for 2017, the inspired calendar of Pirelli from the 1970s.
But instead of revealing acquaintances, they are trying to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine full of nudity was different from the Playboy of old school, because Singaporean Playboy is for men. Sorry.'
I do it for women.
Evidently he believes the calendar too.
Sneak peek We have to go back to displaying timeless and classic nudity, when they feel comfortable with both women and men, and they are inspired by the photos of the female body, the critic 'stated Shaw in a press release to release the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can send their pictures online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where's vinyl heading: Who's really buying the gramophone records?
Vinyl loves lonely men of middle age.
Before you choose a section of the comments section to turn the pectoral notes under the pseudonym NeEveryichniOsammingMiddle Tower, we note that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurrection of gramophone boards is linked not to a boom of millennials who want to coax the originality of owning a physical object, but with a nostalgic midlife.
Those who recently bought an album on vinyl are the most likely people aged between 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It's not really about the hoarding of an enthusiastic fan - the whole thing has an emotional dimension: Older people who buy gramophone records are more likely to keep their feelings -LRB- 56% versus 53% -RRB- and they're like -LRB- 69% versus 66% -RRB-.
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog was sent off as a TV story, the camera would follow me heading into the busy street in Soho, dressed in a deference grey suit and widely gesticulating, then I would stop, take out my hands and say something authoritative, like:
So let's take a look.
While the heart of Soho is slowly fading away from its charm and charm - buildings once occupied by independent retailers, they are now filled with hotels, restaurants and dinners, confectionery and office supplies - some fantastic specialist shops with gramophone plates have yet to be left.
I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while, and I'm going to stand close to the different men in these stores and see what their age and emotional state are like.
Stuart-LRB- 55-RRB-, a man from Glasgow, whom I watch from Sister Ray-LRB- figures: Two young women, three men of middle age - RRB- to Reckless Records -LRB- figures: Eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20-RRB- has a meeting in London in the afternoon and looking through the business to fill in a few hours of time.
I ask him if he's a collector.
Chilling VERDICT I think yes, texting 'says.
I have about three or four thousand recordings.
All those recordings leveraged the walls of his living room - in the image above -LRB- the picture sent me an e-mail, I didn't follow him to his home -RRB-.
This huge amount of albums and singles also has because he can afford it: He can now buy the gramophone records he couldn't afford when they came out initially, and he's buying what he sold in his youth and he didn't even have a vincent.
Texting spree A lot of what I buy is from the late 1960s and from the early 1970s.
He agrees that those who buy the recordings are probably introverts who like themselves.
This is my sin.
Wez-LRB- 25-RRB- works in Sister Ray and also thinks that many of the customers he meets fits the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave, people who heard about the comebacks and felt compelled to buy their old gramophone records back.
According to my interviews, the people of their collections were stripped most frequently between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their gramophone records and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their gramophone records back, kangaroo says.
That might explain the boom-lover boom of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of gramophone records?
It won't take more than a few seconds for you to shop in a shop like Phonica to find a pleasant community of people with similar sentiments.
According to Weze, some elderly customers are particularly offended by the contactless payments system.
Some of the phonograph fans can feel cornered in the digital world, and have opted for a familiar environment of phonograph records, things that bring back memories of peaceful adolescence.
Sneak peek I think that completing the gap or owning something tangible can make some comfort, texting 'says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, for me it's that and I think in a lot of people too.
It's an easy way to fill a place in your head.
Emotional Reveals We are all like their social workers! The footage has been heard by a collaborator from the piles of gramophone records.
In April, the ICM survey revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier did not yet hear it.
According to the survey, 41% of those surveyed have a gramophone that they never use, while 7% of those who buy gramophone records don't have a gramophone.
In this section of the story, he was probably really concerned about walking through the pile of compounding the bossa nova.
An aspect of the giveaway trophy of the trophy and the revival of interest is something that has been noticed by Jonny-LRB- 42-RRB-, who works in the Sounds of the Universe-LRB- number: Three men of middle-aged -RRB-.
Celebrities wannabe Somebody recently came in and said, 'I don't have a gramophone yet, but I want to buy on the board of Radiohead so we can put it on the shelf, texting' texting 'talk.
The percentage of such is not large, but it occurs.
It's more about the product side than the music.
It comes to us people who say: Congrats to Gramofon 'I don't have.'
Those are younger people, not the older, the roster of teenagers who get into it.
Fopp, where there is currently nearly one floor reserved for gramophone records, has a much more diverse visitors on my arrival.
There are pairs of seventies, tourists who do photos, teenagers and women of middle age.
While the atmosphere is not as much relaxed as stores before - from loudspeakers, instead of a tractor-like jazz, it echoes the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex, it's good to see different customers.
None of them looks particularly lonely, but intrusive mental trauma is hard to fathom when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora -LRB- 27 -RRB- with a few minutes in Fopp going through and looking at different gramophone records at a discount.
It is one of those who are more likely to look at expenses rather than spend feverishly.
In his words, he doesn't make much money, so it's out of the question that the gramophone records were collected.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to the music on the computer or the like, but the gramophone records have its magic.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a business that reportedly inspired a new generation of gramophone records: Urban Outfitters.
I look like I'm very interested in calves of girls in upmarket jeans, and I'm watching a group of teenage girls who are just clucking around the Polaroid cameras, then my father and daughter decide to buy the gramophone of Crosley.
To the left is a staircase whose walls cover the gramophone records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Maca: A blend of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of gramophone records.
No one looks at them - perhaps precisely because they are just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they can't be reached on them.
It's purely extortionate vindication of the scam.
But because any attraction to him could mean more money for the industry and sending several customers to the depths of Soho for others, there's not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where more time and money is more likely than in other areas, is also the one where most spend on the most luxurious goods the vinyl certainly is.
But while according to my findings, YouGov's results appear to be accurate - at least in the record with gramophone records, do not take into account a large number of Scots and wine lovers who exist in fact, in the store with gramophone records and online forums.
These people are probably working hard in schools or offices.
I'm sure he doesn't spend Thursday morning wandering around with gramophone records at Berwick Street, going through the recording and avoiding looking at the strange, thirty-year-old fake TV anchorman lurking behind the back of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The Greenland shark is the longest surviving vertebrate - a video recorder
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.

Court in France refused to demolish the shops in the Jungle refugee camp
The court in France rejected the orders of the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 makeshift shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer cutting of hair, in makeshift restaurants selling tea at 50 cents or basic meals for several euros.
The prefect's office in Calais argued that the places needed to be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they pose a risk of fire and health risk.
Humanitarian organisations have said in court that shops and restaurants are vital and that free meals offered by state-backed associations and other groups do not provide an addition to food for growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Disputed makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and food free to people in need.
The court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from operating the 72 makeshift business, but said that the objections of the prefect of Calais were the imminence of completely understandable giveaways.
Judge Jean-François Molla said stores of food, cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role than mere submission to food to people who cater to living in extremely desperate conditions.
He said the premises provide calm places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places she threatened to demolition was a cafe in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, hosted by a nonprofit organization and which offers 200 meals, hours of English and French and asylum counselling for hundreds of endangered unaccompanied minors in the camp.
A petition to protect a Singaporean children's Singaporean 'cafe has been signed by more than 170 000 people.
The Guardian has received a letter saying that the closure of a cafe scoring spree would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are just 8 years old.
The charity Help Refugess and Lochaber Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the numbers of refugees in the camp after a steep increase in arrivals over the years had risen to more than 9,000 - which is so far at all times.
He thought he was dead.
Ulch crosses himself and the volleyball Ústí.
Since March I was able to train normally, scoring 'reported on the start of the summer preparations in full force.
What happened to you?
I had a two-sided pulmonary embolism, then because of that, my heart problems.
Because when I was at the University of Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble caused a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my calf for two years and I didn't know about it.
It hurt me, no one could find me.
Then the clot went up.
There's a damaged vein in the calf, it's going to hurt all the time, especially when it's working or the weather changes.
But nothing that would limit me, rather an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
He did.
Last year at a summer tournament in Inglewood, I didn't know I had an embolism, and I couldn't move there at all.
I was vomiting blood tonight.
The doctors told me it was something else, I was completely wiped out for five days.
I really thought I was dead in Inglewood, even my girlfriend and family.
I've seen somewhere else.
How did you compare yourself to that?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just going to go up.
I know I have some blood problems that I need to watch more when I fly somewhere.
But you can do it all.
Just when I was about to get back in training last year, there were still problems with my heart.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I'll knock it off, physically I'm better than I was before.
What do you expect from Ústí?
I'm looking forward to the crew looking good, I know most of the boys.
I'm curious about two more strangers coming.
Perhaps we'll sit down in human beings to make it fit.
Will you pick up Ústí?
It had a reputation for bruising, but every season is different.
The Brno two years ago was eighth, now the second.
There's a new team in Ústí, only a few players left.
It was the last one in the extreme, so there's plenty of room for improvement.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see after the first rounds, who's going to be an otter, we don't.
Is it a guarantee of Brom's success?
He's been experienced and experienced a lot, going to be better than the last place.
But my approach didn't match him, I got off early.
There were other coaches in the game, with one I'm a big friend and it was agreed to operate here.
I'm not calling the name.
Finally, Mr Brom came and I was glad.
He has a big name, he was in good clubs, he's been training for a lot of decades, he's a former good player.
Move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to heckle and I like to get the opportunity in not such a top team.
I've been two years in the Potters, Ústí is a bigger challenge than being right in the sixth team because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned a stranger, in Ústí, he's already training the Aussie Boer.
What does he look like?
As a matter of fact, I know him, at the university, we played against each other in the group.
And we had a couple of times together, and sometimes we sat together for the night after the game, so we know each other's friends.
We beat them 3-1, I immediately fed it to him on the start of the summer.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
The American Nadazdin and Brazile of Ze will still arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
With an American I wrote, he seems like a good kid, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
You contacted the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm a recording artist, the one who makes up, so I should communicate with everyone.
I was immediately finding out what the player was, I found myself on the internet playing, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the kid jumps, he's tall.
We wrote a couple of messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, fit in with us.
How do you feel about the position of the recording number one?
I didn't want to take anything else.
After all, I'll be twenty-four, and I don't have the nature to take turns.
I prefer to be at the center of things, rather than being led by someone else.
I probably wouldn't want to play anymore if I was to be a second recording player and devote myself to full time.
How many times have you been one?
A half-year in The Order, when it wasn't Kusto as captain, was hurt, then there was money problems and he left.
Since then, we've been climbing up and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, which I am dedicated to, I have alternated one and two.
The great year was in the Old City, I had a lot of offers after him, and I picked out the Potato.
I stayed out of there, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short halfback remains Phelps's domain.
Stripping the footage to be again on the steps of the winners and to hear the anthem is sweet as always, the comedian 'laughed at Phelps, yet again his eyes were full of tears.
His fiancée and mother were once again cheering in the auditorium, the son of Boomer this time peacefully sleeping with earphones on his ears.
I'm experiencing an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started to swim and it will be over in a few hours, he said.
In the final for Phelps, nearly two seconds backfired by silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won a long halfback.
The bronze was acquired by Chinthu Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Cup.
After Alu Oerter -LRB- disk -RRB- and Carl Lewis -LRB- long-range -RRB- is Michael Phelps's third athlete who has mastered the same discipline on four games in a row.
For most of the race, Phelps was held in the lead by another American Ryan Lochte and home Thiago Perreira.
While the defence of gold in the final craze of the Fifties put on a crushing final, they fell outside of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one chance to extend his unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the ceremonial announcement of the halfback he advanced to the final of the race for the 100-metre butterfly.
The legend could not be overshadowed by the countryman Ryan Murphy, who won the character's double - after a hundred wins in Rio and double the line.
In the final, he left on 37-seeded Australian swimmers Mitchell Larkin, the third finished by Russian Evgeny Rylov.
While out of last year's World Cup, Murphy only has the fifth place of the two-hundred, in Rio, to become a signpost king.
From the poignant throne, he took down Larkin, who had managed the same double-double in last year's world championships.
But he won a medal at the Olympics only now.
On the crafty hundred, the Canadian was thanked by Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel.
For 16-year-old Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal in these games, for Manuela's second after silver from the shootout.
Swimming gold has won on the OH as the first African-American woman in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, the sport will become love for them and they'll get to where I am, she said, touched by Manuela.
The third was Sweden's Sarah Sjöström, who won the race for a 100-metre butterfly in Rio's world record and has still silver from a crafty two-hundred.
Up to the sixth ended the world record of Aussie Cate Campbell.
The first two-hundred won Japanese for Rie Kanet, for whom it was the first Olympic medal in the 27 years.
It has no valuable metal or from the World Cup, its maximus was fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Russia Yuliya Jefimov, who, despite the doping past, is facing hostility to both spectators and rivals.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should still answer these questions.
I'm very tired of it, the Russian swimmer said.
The right of takeoff in Rio has been won up to a special panel of sports arbitrage of the CAS right before the start of the Games.
They dealt with my appeal, and I won.
Whether he likes it or not, or if he has a different opinion to go to the Arbitration Court, she added.
Heroic: Disappointment, we could have won.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs had a special day.
Only less than an hour before the game, they knew who it was going to be.
They must have been able to handle the tactical preparation.
And then, in the non-traditional time, they started the game on the little court number 1.
The first set didn't start well, then they drew the edge of the competition, but at 19: 19 they didn't make the finish.
In the second, they were clearly better and levelled, but the decisive tiebreak didn't work out.
First of all, a series of poached servicemen meant a loss of 10: 15 and goodbye to the Olympic tournament.

How would you evaluate the game?
Heralded: After an unfortunate start before I broke up, we were pretty much into the game.
In the end, in the last balloon, the income I had gotten used to.
We lost the set, which was the key.
In the next meeting, we got them on the field, another defense, and we pushed for the service.
There was an awful lot of bad filing in the tiebreaker, that's where we picked up this page.
It was disappointing because we could beat Rusky.
Headline: The damage to the start of the first set, we missed it there.
We could pull it off, but we missed the spikes.
The second set was great and in the third the service.
We made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points and about the five that was, there was a lot of hesitation.
It's a shame because Rusky was proud.
How did you play on the little court number 1?
Headline: Similar to in China on the sidelines.
The environment and the atmosphere were different.
There was one hour at night, complete silence, the music wasn't playing, there was nothing.
That was the difference from downtown.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the game when you found out the names of the match an hour before the game?
Hermanns: She was special.
We started training for the game without knowing the counter-games, so we couldn't make tactical preparations like the other teams.
But Simon-LRB- bites of Nausch-RRB- were adding the tactic to almost all the options that were there.
He had a lot of paperwork with tactics, so we were pretty well prepared after this page.
Do you remember ever starting the game at midnight?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played at 10: 30, but not 12.

Headline: By playing the last two games in a group of ten, we've had the regime shifted before.
This was two hours more.
It's strange, I can't imagine another sport having athletes who have to serve their best performance at twelve o'clock.
But I think we prepared as best as we could.
We knew it would be, but it's not quite typical, and it's probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you value the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the process of the group was our goal, that's fine for one party.
We handled what we said.
But now I'm sad after the game.
Headline: I'll sleep out of it, and from tomorrow I'll remember only positive for the Olympic tournament.
Big Brother is here, comes the first peep-show SIM.
You can't escape her.
The new rules should apply to all non-Thai passport holders who choose to obtain SIM from local operators during their stay in Thailand.
Not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas, which in Thailand, for example, have been working or closed down.
In fact, the Secretary-General of the Office of National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission Takorn Tantasith informed that there would be no exceptions.
The plan to sell SIM intended exclusively to foreigners was introduced by the national telecoms regulator in early August.
New measures to allow monitoring of their positions intend to be introduced by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasitha, it is a means to preserve national security, which will enable the criminally committed to be dealt with by foreigners.
In addition, the so-called tourist SIM is to help expose people who exceed the duration of the stay.
For retailers, by half a year, a special SIM for foreigners should also appear alongside SIMs intended exclusively to Thai people.
The following shall be a function of monitoring that will be permanently switched on for card-designated persons without a Thai passport.
She won't be able to turn it off.
Prostate gland This function in the SIM for Thai is not, because we can always easily follow, the defender has added to Tantasith.
It must be said that in Thailand, pre-placenta is not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires a document of identity.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators gave away free start-up SIM tourists at airports.
Those were fully anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand is also considering ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries including, for example, Malaysia or Singapore.
There is currently a compulsory registration of SIMs, but the legal use of the monitoring system is not possible.
However, the forthcoming measure does not mean an obligation for foreigners to acquire a SIM local operator when entering the country.
They can, of course, use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
In fact, the operators of the country concerned are aware of the relevant network information when they cross the border, that is, when they log on to their network.
So they know the phone number, but not the information about the owner.
However, the difference in roaming prices relative to the rates of local operators is so abysmal that even most tourists during their stay in Thailand will start looking for local SIMs.
The authorities "efforts to control the movement of foreigners from foreigners living in Thailand have legally received immediate criticism.
Tantasith is calming the situation, and in relation to protecting the privacy of the forthcoming system, it likens the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents.
Moreover, police will need a court order if necessary.
For any abuse of the system, there will be an unspecified punishment.
Colombian defender Budeto service provider to monitor the location of the SIM without a court order, will be charged with a criminal offence, defender 'added Tantasith.
The system should also maximise the use of prepaid cards.
While there will currently be a recycle of a specific number up to the expiry of the 90-day period, after which the SIM has not been applied to the network, the new number could be recovered after 15 days in the event of the abandonment of Thailand.
A luxury apartment in the New Building at Vinyard has a pool and a Jacuzzi on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in the new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment, where most of the care of the property's obstetrician.
There was plenty of parking places and a lift in the house, which in effect disqualified the older pledge.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with rocking floors, high energy intensity and the like.
Big terraces were also a condition, an old pledge not able to offer.
You'll find more interesting visits in the Modern Suite.
The entire interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langer with his colleague Kamila Polák of the Art Academy.
Why did you call them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to each?
Cooperation with the architect would be recommended to everyone if it proposes an apartment from the outset, namely a very complex technical process.
The second plane is the design of the interior itself: Designers have a significantly better idea of a range of possible materials and, based on the wishes of the client, the interior is able to align appropriately.
With architect Lenka Langer, we were working together on our mountain apartment, then based on a personal recommendation of another client, and given that everything worked well, there was a clear choice for us in the reconstruction of our new apartment at Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social-living space with the corresponding pledges for the four-person family as modern but not cool interior.
The priority was to link the apartment building to the terraces and implement intelligent household control.
And, of course, the quality of the implementation was needed.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you interfere in the final form of the interior?
All proposals including technical drawings and samples of materials were approved, but the proposal has always come from architects.
At the start, we set out what we expect from the design, and showed some of the elements of the interior that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think that just our collection of mostly Czech authors involving the works of Karl Malik, Karla dried, Wenceslas or Otto Gutfreunda's architect helped navigate our taste.
Also, the combination of black, white and nut wood was the idea of the architect as much as the individual pieces of furniture, the walls, the floor, the lighting, the carpets, the fabric, the art, etc.
Were there any complications that you had to give up, or, on the other hand, to make a new one?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project when we came to the building at the moment when it was first possible to climb to the height of our floor, and found that the projections we had planned to actually shadow the surrounding buildings.
At that time, the dislocation literally changed overnight.
Granite was used on the kitchen counter as well as the lining of the neck wall.
In the interior, wooden surfaces filled with leather, for example, on cushioning dining and bar chairs Norma from Arpen.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make any changes or is there anything you wish to do today?
I believe it is a modern airy interior that, above all, performs its purpose.
We are not going to change the changes, most of the adjustments after the move have taken place on the level of shielding and housing terraces.
Perhaps the only complaint is to the floor when walnut wood shows us as too delicate a household with a dog.
The word "architect," Ing. Lenka Langer and MgA. Kamila Hornych, author of the realisation.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, which is why it was possible to implement a completely new dispositional resolution and a few other modifications as part of the structure.
For the interior, it is an important element of the location of the flare-ups in the ceiling of the corridor and the main toilets.
That's how we got the daylight into the dark quarters of the apartment.
Also direct input from the main bathroom on the roof terrace to the pool from the USSPA is one of the building arrangements that has been very beneficial to the office of the entire apartment.
It also includes a pool and a Jacuzzi.
You are not negative compared to the French, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, a short distance from the Spanish border.
I've been moving around quite a lot.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, which I then got to work in a magazine.
So why did you choose to move out of the country?
I was beginning to feel that I was suffocating in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere among the people.
I found that every Frenchman was terribly negative.
People in France are negatively tuning in generally, but it's been getting worse lately.
It's interesting that you mention negativity.
In fact, some people assess the English nature.
Trust me, you're not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not find it that way when they come to France because they don't see it as tourists so much.
But it was too much for me.
The big issue is money.
People feel that they have little money, yet the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there is also a problem with the behaviour of people towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street I was living in, my non-Muslim neighbour started looking through my fingers just because I was a Muslim.
As if I were evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for work basically anywhere else, and I ran into a vacancy at Air France here in Prague.
I confess that I did not know from the beginning of Prague.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father told me about what was going on in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mostly because of a different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak English, so I can't pick up any negative reactions or curses, but I feel like there are people fresher here.
That I can do anything, dress myself, and no one will judge me.
In France, you still get an uncomfortable look at you, like when you have special clothes and stuff.
In Prague, I began to feel really free.
Prague, I don't think they care about that sort of thing.
Where do you work now?
After a job at Air France, I worked for one travel site for a while.
Then, with one friend, we set up a website on which people offer and look for shared housing.
So far we have only served in Prague, but we would like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are the Czechs of the half, and two other friends of the Czech Republic.
I have to say that the other specifics of the Czechs are that at first they keep their distance.
They won't let anyone get to the body.
That's quite a difference from where I grew up.
In the South, everyone is hugging and kissing on the face.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural thing, so I try to adapt.
You mentioned you didn't speak English.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, I have it simple in Prague, because perhaps everyone here speaks English.
Even in the evenings or in food.
I'd like to learn English, but I don't have that much time.
And by the fact that everyone can at least communicate in English, I don't have the need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you encountered any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
Not really.
It may also be that I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience strikes me.
My supervisor, the Czech Republic, once told me about the French football team and said something in a sense: They are not French, but Africans.
That kind of touched me.
But that someone has a problem with being Muslim, that hasn't happened to me before.
And even though my colleague once alerted me to some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go downtown to call me names.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly linked to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Do you fear that something like Paris, Nice, or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is that anything can happen nowadays.
Until recently, I might not have imagined that such a thing would happen in France.
And it's not just Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me, people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says you have no right to kill because there is no God.
How do you see that when terrorists are lining up your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to follow the violence reports, but every time I read something, I have a need to apologize for something that isn't really my fault.
I'm a different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We are gathered in the Square of George of Poděbrad.
On Wednesday, the English Muslims, along with the Christians, demonstrated against the violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know about that.
But I understand that those people feel the need to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they would have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't cause?
Do you meet in Prague and other Muslims?
My collaborators, for example, are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They are a little more religious than me, so we have sometimes quite a wild discussion about Islam because we all see it a little bit differently.
I come from France, so I went through another education, they had to learn Islam at school.
We have different approaches but we respect each other.
Sometimes, people associate Islam with the subordinate position of a woman.
How do you see that?
I am under no circumstances.
Rather, on the contrary.
I'm a woman. I have strength.
It has to do with the fact that you don't wear any blanket of a head.
A hijab, for instance?
And it's signing up to the way I was raised.
My mum, for example, is a really principled Muslim.
She prays five times a day, but she just doesn't wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith was purely personal.
It depends on how she interprets it.
If you read the Koran, you should make your own opinion on those things.
So when I read a passage in the Koran that says that God told Prorook to hide his women in front of the others, I said: I am not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and when it comes to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the scarves require, I take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far.
I haven't felt so good anywhere else.
I thought about Poland for a while, but I'm great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is an ideal city for me.
English Muslims, along with Christians, have demonstrated against violence.
Yachtass Kozel Fencalo's wind in Rio has taken a tie to the match.
Friday's ride at sea in the Brazilian Riu de Janiero has been published by Czech yachtsman Veronica Kozel Fencova.
In the class of Laser Radial, she moved ahead of the final two contemplations in tenth place.
That would ensure Chechnya's participation in the final.
You'll pick up the packages as a compliment.
They want to compete with the carriers.
Behind the idea of using the planned trip to transport the shipments is television director Maj. Liška and the manager of Prague music club Mark Greger.
With the idea, they breathed life of a trio of applications with a different geographic range.
We launched the national application in May.
At the moment, there are thousands of cities in it, and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn that first, before we focus more on the foreign exchange, he says, in an interview with an iDNES.cz one-time manager.
How does the application work and who can benefit from it?
Download it and register it free.
Then you can enter the route and the data on how the big package can be taken over and how much you want for it.
Someone's gonna be asking for a transfer back in that day.
When both the route and the time of delivery are met, it will be paired, and the two will come by mutual notification.
At that moment, he opens a chat where the couple can arrange a transfer.
How many people would you think would have to register for each package to always find its courier?
I don't know the ideal condition, I can't guess how many registered and how many trips it takes to cover completely optimal, and every offer has been paired with demand.
It already works on the main moves, and it's logically simpler than maybe on the road between the villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People are building trust, too, and finding that no one is going to get away with the package.
So far, you haven't had to deal with such a case?
How many users have a service after two months from the launch?
At the moment, we have about 5 to 6,000 people making the roads.
We consider that a success and we believe they will be packed with others.
Don't you think the sender's going to wait too long?
We hope to be competing for large conglomerates for just the reason that we are able to deliver the matter even the same day and at a fraction of the price.
You will pay several thousand for the big company to deliver within two hours.
You'll pay $100 or less, because that's the way someone's already in business.
Should traditional carriers worry about a possible decline in customers in the future?
We hope that will be the case.
The market has huge potential, feeding huge multinational carriers here, as well as the trade chains, where they have all started to shop and have gradually found that quality does not correspond to what they pay for.
No one wants to find a leaf in the mailbox with a message to pick up the shipment at the branch, first the day after the 19th.
By then, I had needed the package for six hours, and I waited at home, because it was important.
We want a better, faster and workable service that will not annoy anyone and send out competition to the signal to try.
Mark Greger -LRB- 41-RRB- and Matthew Fox -LRB- 39-RRB-.
Neither has ever been in the field of information technology.
Mark Greger works as a music club manager, Matthew Fox as a television director.
In 2014, they started preparing the Shippansee LTD, which is used to transport packages already scheduled to travel between the world's metropolitan cities, primarily by aircraft.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to process the company that created applications for Mall.cz, Jobs.cz or CSSFD.
Programming took three quarters of the year and the application placed on the market in March 2016.
The transfer began to evolve in December last year and set out in May this year.
This is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
Mesika and Mecca Profi developed from this January and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was to make all these apps from the start, which one day will unite at one.
In the Czech Republic, they want the application of the dollar and then, in collaboration with a strong investor, to focus on the global market.
The shared economy has been the subject recently and this is an AirBnB or Uber service.
Are you not worried about being in an area that no one can say so far, where the boundaries of sharing and where the gray economy is?
It's the same, just another product.
We know that if it's going to be a success and we're going to go up with that, we're going to be the next thorn in the eye through the grey economy.
But while someone will spare and be made, it is not the intention to circumvent the financial authorities and tax controls.
Any user, either on one or the other, will be encouraged to make Danil their income if they make the income of it.
What do you think the service has so great potential?
The sender will save and the ferries earn, respectively, reduce the cost of the journey.
There's a strong thought in that that combines interest on both sides.
At the time of the social networks that divide people, we would like this one to converge.
There may be nice stories, people are happy about helping someone and they're going to tell about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
People have been lacking in personal access for a long time, we're saying this app is a service to people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier is not running away with the package?
Each user application, together with the registrations, will scan a citizen's card and give a bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are the channels that give the service and the person their credibility.
The couriers also collect stars on the basis of an assessment of the genders.
We also offer insurance, we're still lashing out the details.
For the uninsured consignment in the event of a loss or damage to a courier, but he does not take responsibility for the content of the criminal law, if there is something illegal inside and does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find a handgun or ten pounds of hash in his suitcase in his trunk, he will take criminal responsibility to the sender.
Isn't there an abuse of sensitive data from the database?
They are, if necessary, to be seen by the administrative authority, which, as the only one, will be able to look at it, nor are we able to see them, the data is protected against abuse.
How much money will the courier receive after the successful delivery of the shipment?
A courier determines the price and gets the full amount he's told.
The sender is charged several per cent in addition to making contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few per cent because we want to push for volume.
The courier also can't be charged that he did not add the package when he actually delivered it, taking the receipt, and the service is being verified by the QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can take anything.
We have three sizes, a little bit like a cube of butter, medium like the eggplant, and a big one like bass.
After that, there's no further restriction, and if someone is in the car, take the refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the opportunity to photograph the package, so the courier can see what he wants.
You don't even have to pack a thing if you don't want to hide the contents.
A forgotten sweatshirt puts the courier in your hand and it is.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to run the service?
A friend got an idea more than two years ago, I didn't pay much attention back then.
Then he showed me a demo application with a super-national range that targeted mostly passengers by plane.
In that moment, I told him I wouldn't be looking for an investor, but I would want to stand by myself and put my savings into that.
The next year, developments took place before we set up Shippansee LTD in London because of the larger credility of the product.
But this is not the version that you are focusing on now.
No, the marketing has been focused on the Czech Republic, where we're trying to catch the application, because the whole thing was in the middle of pain, and there's still something to do and improve.
We are trying to respond to feedback from customers and the foreign market at the moment we are not doing so much.
We know it's a run for the long haul, but we don't want to, we want to create a really good product for people.
The Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive apps, the other two were in their way of upgrading.
The transfer was made when we were told that the national segment could be much more interesting and that at least we could learn that in the Czech Republic.
The third application of Mecca is local, for the city.
But he can send the package to an exact address on the other end of the world.
It works for the sender as well as I take, but the difference is that in it as a courier you see the shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in your mobile.
The apps for couriers who want to feed it, we called the Mecca Profi.
So anyone can make an outright profit by picking up packages around the city?
Exactly, the last application will be pulled in Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make the trip to work.
How now everyone messes with those pokies, they can pick that up exactly the same way.
A man can see where the city's contracts are, he'll come to it, click, and see when it must be delivered and transported.
It's cheaper than competing services.
At the moment, we are doing an even web interface that will be pivotal for companies to send mail, to complete the data on the site, or create points on the map.
We are then able to make use of the service every month.
Are you now a full-time project?
It benefits us, but we have it normally in employment so that we can support the project and develop it.
There is no hiding behind us a strong multinational investor, we are two boys, one of whom had a brilliant idea, and the other has been involved with other stimuli and ideas.
Now, we are looking for an investor strong enough to handle us, not the Czech market, but with the passing of the ball to go with us in the global product and become another huge player in the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story part of the Titanfall 2 is to produce an almost forgotten variety.
This will correct the second episode, and the solo game will be more diverse than in Call of Duty, according to the first information.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling should be based on the concept of networking in the first part.
So enjoy the freedom of movement, which, in addition to running, includes the ability to use the fighting titan.
In addition to action passages, the game will contain levels focused just on the vertebrate movement.
They will resemble platforms and include puzzles.
Thus, for example, double jumps, running on walls and a line of rope, are essential, for example.
Moreover, it will also have to be disposed of by enemies.
There will be no maps reminiscent of the maze and levels with special concepts.
For example, it will be possible to pick up platforms and close a massive door.
To modify this will be the form of the battlefield.
The pace of the game should oscillate between fierce action and calmer moments for exploring an unknown planet.
We play for Jack Cooper's pawn of the pilot's career.
Cooper at the start of the campaign, together with Captain Lastimosa, will crash on the alien planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And it lends itself to its wilderness.
In addition, Lastimosa will suffer fatal wounds in the crash, and Cooper will be given the task of making the captain's titan.
His dream of a pilot's career will come true sooner than he expected.
But the first step would be to steal the battery necessary for the robot's repair.
There will also be calls for Cooper with a titan.
The players will serve as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time, the robot's outgoing communications will be a humorous moment.
For example, when the titan is wryly listed all the injuries that Cooper is in for a planned jump shot.
The first information about the campaign in the Titanfall 2 was brought by the Polygon server.
In addition, the result will be assessed in two months, and Bonusweb will give you first impressions of the network game after Gamescombe.
The Titanfall 2 is out on 28 October, for PCs, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ tag is alive, but the original publisher remains dead.
Swedish company Nordic changes the name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of THQ, in 2013, it received a number of its brands and the right to use the logo as well as the name of the company.
The Nordic contributed, for example, to the Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition or Red Faction Collection.
In addition, there are a further 23 games for publishing, and 13 of them have not yet been revealed.
Thirty years ago, when I retired, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found twenty years younger, our neighbor.
I knew it from the start - first, obviously, she had been trying for a long time, then they got together.
She's such a big guy, probably her type, because she used to come in front of me.
She's totally crazy about him.
In those early days, she had even changed her voice, had such a girlish, loving voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she beeped it.
But I watched the whole thing.
He'd been out of work regularly at 3: 30, and she always left in three to buy.
Every day she tried to see him.
Later, I figured they'd meet him in the house, in the laundry room.
How many times I knew they were there.
I got my keys, and I was determined to catch them.
But I don't know why, I've always stayed at home.
I've never been able to go in there, make that decisive move.
You may be laughing at me, but I believe my wife's mind is controlling me.
I soon found out I was in control that I was going to do what she wanted.
And I did.
Maybe I'm just a pussy.
At the same time, the neighbours suggested she knew about it as well.
I was so stupid that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all burst, he'd be sick.
That in the family of all things, only a daughter knew something.
So I always put it off, on and on.
But once I went to his apartment, I needed help in the laundry room.
He went in there with me and I told him I had received an anonymous call that he was meeting with my wife and that he was suggesting everything.
I asked him what he would tell me.
He stood there, shrugging, looking into the ground, and said nothing.
Then I also met his wife on the road from the store at the time.
I told her, but she didn't believe it.
She didn't respond to it, and she didn't tell me.
Nobody told me anything back then.
I am such a man who never went anywhere very much, who has a problem with someone, let alone find a woman.
So I didn't even think about the divorce.
I was still relying on that one day to end.
I thought I'd forgive her, and life would go on.
But that wasn't the case.
And I've never been able to deal with all that.
I still have it in me.
I used to give it to her very often, but I ended up leaving for peace.
He continues to live in the next house, and I continue to live with her.
It's just, rather than my wife, my housekeeper.
She always did everything at home - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's busy.
She has always tried to make me no other reason to complain.
And you can say she's nice.
But sometimes I want to pet her, give her a hug, and she won't let go.
We are going out for walks and shopping together and everyone thinks what a happy marriage we have.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she had me and liked me, but that she didn't love me.
And I can see that he loves him to this day, it's her god.
And I don't enjoy living like that.
It was then when it started and I carried it very badly, I once told her I didn't want to live and asked what she would say if I had finished it.
I wanted to know if she'd agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought about it, and finally she said, "Adorable, but there's plenty of room."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
After the terrorist attacks, France is stepping up the fight against radical Islamists, and the government and the local Muslim minority are calling for help.
Deeply flawed If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who distort public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee the freedom of their religion, the defender has said of Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual education in France is shown in the country.
It also wants to stem the funding of mosques from abroad, with money often coming from preachers inoculated by jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wanted to establish a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
It was then intended to contribute to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and countries that finance their construction.
But internal contradictions soon intervened, and it never worked properly.
Verdict Reveals It's a total failure, defender 'stated Valls.
At the head of the new foundation, it appears to be former interior minister and defence minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as a supporter of the secular state.
In France, roughly 2500 mosques and prayers are served, about 120 of which serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, French authorities from the country have expelled some 80 Islamic clerics and have been considering this step in several other decades.
This week, German police intervened against the jihadist clergy.
The imams reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them ran a space where the faithful reportedly radicalized and later attacked a Sikh temple in Essen.
In the wake of the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate has erupted in France about a new institution that will replace the failed foundation.
All were hastened by other terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two major challenges to ensure funding for mosques from domestic sources, as well as to oversee the imams.
But it is not yet clear where it will receive funding, even though several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee for halal food, especially for meat coming from defeats by Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by sellers of halal meals, in order to provide a permit.
Some of the money would then go to the foundation's budget.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Each year, there are about 30,000 on the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
Moreover, in French mosques, only preachers who passed education programs in those universities should operate.
Because of this, their sermons should be in line with democracy.
The government is also closing radical mosques.
In the aftermath of December, we have arrested twenty and others will follow, the Minister's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
Deeply flawed In France, there is no place for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men, Singaporeans said.
Zaragoza.
His former wife was badly injured by an unknown gunman on Friday morning at a shopping mall in north-Spanish Zaragoza, the Independent reports.
The shooting occurred after a woman with her daughter left the premises of the garage in her car.
The man was waiting in the car in front of the shopping centre, where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun against himself, the Independent reports.
A woman was taken to hospital by an uninjured daughter, an ambulance had to arrive for the man in critical condition.
The act occurred at around 11.00 in the central part of the metropolitan area of Aragonia, near the local university.
With an appeal to Spain's Europa Press, he writes to the Independent that the motive was probably unresolved by the recent divorce of the two partners.
Whiskers with asparagus, wakame eyelashes, ginger and chilli sauce.
Summer wants light, well-nourished meals, but we Czechs are rebels, and we have our appetites and our heads.
And so, from the summer gardens, it smells of grilled crisps, brisket, pork pins.
Nothing too healthy, not too easy, with the exception of lettuce or roasted vegetables.
True, the grilling is economical on time and dishes, plus it's a social issue and no one has to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives as to how well the delicacies that special tables are, their preparation represents a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to make a long-winnable, bake, fry or choke.
And they will contribute to our health.
Whether it's home sushi or sashimi, where high-quality raw materials and a few well-oiled grips will be enough to make the preparation fun and food itself a real exotic delicacy.
Like an even easier roll in the rice paper from today's recipe.
There's even more time-consuming cooking and cooling off the rice.
The paper can only be softened into the water for a moment, and then it's only up to the imagination of the chef as he intends to play with the stuffing and accessories.
It's not kelp like kelp.
The advantage of the many dishes of Asian cuisine is now that raw materials are commonly available.
Including pickled sweet ginger, which is one of the basic potholes accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but the true pink gari ginger has a unique spicy sharp and delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe that blends from several types of vinegar and ginger.
Thus, it is sufficient to purchase a bag of equivalent size, and an attachment with demonstrable antibacterial effects, supporting digestion as well as the resistance to cough or flu, is done.
Banana leaves.
They are particularly used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes within a variety of celebrity occasions and rituals.
The long-ribbed leaves of the banana tree are very prevalent in a number of countries of Asia or South America as well as a Singaporean aid kit 'for the preparation of a variety of baked, cooked and fried foods, which are packed into them in the same way as the foil.
The banana leaf will then hand out a specific flavour.
For us, they can be bought in shops with exotic fruit and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of a collection.
However, select only the leaves of the green, and therefore healthy - unbroken and unfazed.
Similarly easy is the preparation of salads from algae wakame, sesame and sesame oil.
He can be bought frozen again.
Who often, or prepares her sushi, will probably know the kelp of nori in particular.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed, which is produced by cutting, pressing, and drying the so-called leaves of nori - that is, a slice intended to make sushi.
Wakame The dark green kelp growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaidó is also fresh and dried, and is as popular as the kelp of nori.
By the way, who wouldn't know the miso soup with wakame, supposedly Asian women are using it for the recovery after giving birth.
And at all, the kelp's effects are almost miraculous.
It clears the blood, strengthens the circulation, even allegedly prevents graying hair and is literally loaded with minerals.
The dried and broken wakame also serves as a spice, for example to flavoured rice.
Fresh eyelashes are first left in the water, then rinsed, placed in boiling water and cooking for half a minute.
After that, cool in the icy water, they cut out the centre ribs and continue to adjust, like a favorite salad.
But to buy it now, frozen, is the simplest solution.
So there is only to be an umpteen roll with easy green filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavours.
Such a bomb of longevity.
If you resist, and you don't throw an extra grilled brisket.
Eat healthy, easy and easy.
Asians know how to do that.
Just a couple of special ingredients and a little bit of skill, and you have interesting fresh food that lags the flavours.
And done is one-two.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots, 40 g white dilution, 100 g green asparagus, 60 g salad pickles, 60 g algae wakame a 60 g sweet chilli sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a spoonful of black sesame, a spoonful of sriracha chilli sauce, 20 g manga and 40 g of pickled gari ginger, a little pint nuts.
First, we prepare the bolts.
The rice paper will be dipped for five seconds into the cold water.
Then we take it out and wait for him to soften.
Meanwhile, in the hot water, we briefly boil the asparagus shoots, roughly after three minutes, to put them in cold water quickly to lose the colour.
On the allowed paper, we insert the filling of the vegetables and wrap up.
We prepare the filling from white radishes, carrots and salad pickles that we cut into fine noodles, mixing them with sweet chilli sauce, adding chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and put on rice paper.
On the banana leaf, we insert the asparagus shoots, add the bolts, and at the end the whole dish will be done by the kelp-waksun, a pickled ginger, a slice of manga, sprinkled with black sesame, and add a couple of pinkish nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in seventies rugby, selecting Fiji takes gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain in a seven-wicket rout ended by nibbling at the last hurdle, Fiji beat in the final game on Thursday night Brits at the Deodoro stadium here in Rio high 43-7.
The Fijians demonstrated a masterful lesson in the processing, folding, hurdles, supporting play, running on a deli and a brutal force - and they got gold, their first Olympic medal at all.
The defeat came with an unruly price of consolation in the form of a silver medal - for Britain's third on a given day - and the British could be proud of their performances in the inaugural Olympic tournament of seven-wicket rugby, defeating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A win over South Africans 7-5 in the semi-finals that same day, it may have frozen in the finals.
But Fiji would also beat the 15-member team in full health.
It may not be a comfort to the Brits, but they may rejoice at the fact that at least one of them will have a gold medal around tomorrow: The main coach of the Fiddler is Ben Ryan, an earlier head of England from Wimbledon.
The Great Britain has travelled a long way.
Eight years ago, under the direction of Ryan, they lost in the Adelaide Sevens every game.
Here they lost one.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji began spectacularly, the passage of the Britons reflected for the joy.
For captain Tom Mitchell and the other teammates, it was like running for a number of buses in the move and the Champions of the World Cup led 5-0 as the oasis of Kolinisau emerged from behind the corner.
The clock showed four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right flank from which the conversion was.
12-0 and Britain has benefited from hitting the ball.
The great Mitchel tried to stop the huge Leona Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring a third time, but only the Fiddler slowed.
In the seventh minute he threw Jasa Veremalua touchdown into the right corner, and the British were losing 17-0.
Nakarawa added more after the return and still had more than 1 minute left on the clock... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouva then penetrated through the languid Brits and lashed to the line where he scored.
After the conversion to the state of 29-0, there was a pause.
It was as if Fiji had been born for rugby, while the British were still learning the transfer.
That's exactly how it is.
The British, after half-time, made the mass changes and the onslaught of the Fiddler had been stopped... for a long four minutes, which, compared to the first half-time, was good until after the brilliant interplay of Fiji's Tuisova.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the Brits, threw a touchdown pass to the left corner for 36-7, but the game had already been won by the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands, and their fans were singing on the catwalks, waving flags and dancing.
It was hard not to admire the utterly exhilarating approach of the Fiddler.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame made another attempt to win the Fiji victory.
There was a whistle, Fidzans embraced, and the British fell on the turf completely.
Earlier that same day, Fiji in the semi-finals beat Japan 20-5 and the UK beat South Africa in a tight semi-final - a difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the first half to lead, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling work of foot, broke through the defensive line and scored in the second half under the hook.
The great late dump of Marcus Watson, brother Anthony of the 15th-century England team, ensured victory - and finally a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanninger to victory in the rowing race inspired the battle of the coach with cancer
You won't find more emotional gold on these Games - and that's what to say.
From the first shot to the last, in the course of 220 treadmill trips to history, Helen Glover and Heather Stannis found more significance in their golden moment at the estacio de Lagoa.
Though there were two of them, there were three of them in the ship, and when the ship was on the surface to meet the other Olympic gold in the race of the women's twin, there was still a voice in the ship of Robin Williams in the ship, and they are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such an outcome.
Their dominance was absolute, overall it was their 39th race in which they remained insurmountable.
What we see - two excellent athletes, as the water level flies with the elegance of the swan - does not reflect the nature of victory altogether.
For each gold medal of rowing, the battalions are the battalions of auxiliary hands which, piece by piece, mean the difference, and no hands have been assisted by more than the hands of a coach who, 30 months ago, did not know whether he would live to see if he had been diagnosed with cancer that day.
In his words, it was doubtful.
I suffered from the bladder cancer that can be operated, and I underwent this operation.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It will change your view of the matter somewhat.
The cancer was reported to Williams in December 2013.
Luck for the whole trio was that he could get treatment at the start of 2014, off-season, and shorten the shortfall to a minimum - if that's what we might call it in such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get myself together quickly.
That was an incentive.
I was in hospital and I was walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but this has been a bit more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who were very nervous in the morning, spoke less than usual as he attempted to manage his own unease.
Stanninga, a captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, who has a mission in Aghistan, said: Tearful This week I've been with emotions at the bottom, maybe it's a bit extreme, but it means so much.'
It again highlights how much it means to me how much we've worked with Helen and Robin as well.
Until now, it was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so he's a huge thanks, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better person for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanninga haven't lost a single race in five years.
The pair put on a stunning rhythm that their rivals couldn't cope with.
Even in the final 500 metres, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark started approaching, Stannis and Glover had a very large reserve.
At the most we were focused at the moment.
Helen screamed: Tearful Don't stop, don't stop scoring.
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn't desire to achieve anything famously.
We weren't looking forward to today's fireworks, we just wanted to fit well, go out and win the race, which we did.
The pair take a year to think before deciding what to do next.
Glover is getting married next week, her nativity TV adventurer Steve Backson.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say it was going to be my last race.
That would be too much pressure.
It took around six months in London to find I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I've got a much better feeling about it, chaps, she said.

Prison?
More like driving people free, says taxi driver Ruskin to a breakout indictment.
The six taxi drivers and a former magistrate in Prague are, as reported by TIME, the defendants.
You have made a series of reports in which you have exposed fraudulent practices as well as those in the group that will be in court.
You faced a few uncomfortable skirmishes with exposed players.
How much is there for you to report on the indictment of members of the organized group?
I've been waiting for some kind of trial.
I'm especially curious about the judgment.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
That's no good.
They should primarily return all stolen money.
And they should return them by bringing all the people free.
That is a somewhat arbitrary solution.
So does that mean that you don't see the potential punishment as effective enough?
For me, it's enough that some of them are so scared that they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one does a ping-pong, another weighs a pizza, and one has completely abandoned it.
The defendants can theoretically be given two to eight years in prison.
Is that an adequate rate?
I generally have a problem with imprisonment.
I consider it a bad punishment.
To put someone in jail, especially in that case, is nonsense.
Such people should return to the society they took.
For a quarter of a century, they committed the name of our country, and they were simply robbing people.
So let's make a good business card and give people away for free.
I can't imagine.
It would work as a public service.
As someone goes to collect garbage, they would get a car, and they would drive people around Prague.
No, I really think they'll finally get probation and they don't care.
They'll find another way to cheat.
He studied at the Film Academy Miroslava Ondosek in Sand and subsequently at the University of Tomas Bati in the Zone.
It belongs to the people who started in the Czech Republic with viral videos and videos directly for the site.
She works as an editor for Internet TV Stream.cz, where she is taking part in a series of programmes, now preparing the show's Prague Guide, which is meant primarily to foreign viewers.
These Rubes, in the form of short stories, advises what services they prefer to avoid in Prague and, on the contrary, are encouraged to use it without fear.
Previously, he was filming a series of names How to do it, City of Fraud, Life in Luxury, A Enough, and Prague vs. Pray.
In the indictment, they talk about them as an organized group.
Police have been watching her for months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be described as mafia?
They're such lovely mobsters, not the kind we know of The Godfather.
It's more about mobsters - juniors, but organised are definitely.
All they have to do is watch each other's shoefly-LRB- taxi checkpoints -RRB-.
Prague is a whole lot.
I have observed that, for example, the main train station is not liked with Paris, Paris doesn't like the cabs waiting at the Charles Spa-LRB- disco club - RRB-
Everyone just watches their own place, and every group is organized.
It appears to be a tangled web.
But the defendants are only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate driver who warned the driver against the checks.
As you say, undesirable phenomena have not disappeared from the streets.
So what percentage of the Prague-based fraudsters in the taxi service, depending on your estimate, is going?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still.
I'm talking about Alec Rylance, for example.
This is a man who is really dangerous - in his car driving a telescopic stick, and every Friday and Saturday stands at Charles Bridge and coaches people.
Last time I went with him, he wanted me for seven hundred and three miles.
His police didn't stop for some reason.
They only picked a few people out of the big group.
But the same situation is also in other locations.
Thus, the indictment of seven people is difficult to eradicate the famous Prague necessities, which appear to have much larger dimensions.
Of course it's no good.
It will help, but all evil is not wrong, that is.
Do taxi drivers who rob foreign tourists still in those same places you showed up in the stories, the Charles Bridge or the Paris street?
Yes, that's right.
They stand in these locations every day and every day violates the decrees.
It ignores both the city police and the Prague Magistrates.
It's not even Kocourkov anymore, but total indifference.
Business of Prague cabs in numbers
Yet some of them, though only part of the group, will get in front of the court.
It's a breakthrough.
So I have to ask: Do you feel satisfaction?
If I took it as satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, it is, and always will be to improve the centre of Prague.
And even if I feel like it's got to be a little bit better, I'll continue to do that.
It needs to be pushed on the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to remove him.
You can't be satisfied with that.
But it's not, of course, there are more.
Are you still trying to confront them directly in the taxis?
Sometimes I do a test drive and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught a cab driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged £560 for three miles, though he then claimed it was £56-LRB- used a trick with a decimal -RRB-.
He had a receipt for it, the cops arrived, and the cabbie was so endearing, he was still walking behind those policemen, asking them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
A taxi driver tipped a decimal point and robbed tourists of $357.
Can you say that the audacity of fraudulent taxi drivers has not stepped down even after you showed the faces of those who charged nonsensical amounts in a short drive?
Their boldness is still incredible.
How did the taxi driver come in with 56 crowns?
The police sent him away saying they couldn't discuss him at the scene because he had issued a receipt.
And that will be, I think, the problem with that court-LRB- six cabs and one ex-official -RRB-.
On the one hand there would be a taxi driver with his receipts, on the other side of the police.
But, according to the Supreme Administrative Court's decision, the magistrate must not use the secret recordings of the taxi service as evidence in the trial.
When I was filming the parts about their cheats, the cabs themselves alerted me to this precedent.
But I've always wanted to use the footage.
Are you concerned that this might even protect them from the trial?
I hope that every judge understands that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten kroner per kilometre because he would not enjoy it.
You were talking about a trick with a decimal point, which, particularly in front of the foreign clients of the underwater taxi driver, is shifting.
Is it still up-to-date, or do you think this trick will continue to be used?
I think we did this trick of broadcasting the show on the contrary.
I recently rode with one taxi driver, praising in front of me that he was the honest taxi driver.
But then I noticed a black cardboard cut from the side of the meter.
When I asked him what he had in there, he told me: Tearful' You know what it is.
When there were no fines on the taxi-swindlers, could they be warned by a court of their colleagues?
Is there anything that can dissuade them from fracking?
You've talked about how to cheat, they'll always find you.
I don't think there can be anything to discourage.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And that's fair cabs who should be fighting more to get them out of there seriously.
I must say, from my experience, that the fair cabs in Prague outnumber you.
But do they want to go against those who spoil the reputation of their services?
They have a taste, but they lack them.
He can't walk too much and can't say exactly what they want.
When they held the demonstration - LRB- because of the proposal for a full-scale restriction coming from the office of Mayor Adrianna Krnar-YY-, it didn't sound very clear what they wanted.
Once they said they weren't protesting against Uber, they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out to be just blocked by the Pig and it was only the best possible advertisement for Uber.
How do you evaluate the Prague Magistrate's approach in addressing the problem of pre-empting fares?
You can see that she had to enter through the criminal police force to deal with something.
Magistrate was short on that.
They had a mole carrying out the information, meaning the taxi department had done its job for several years altogether.
I hope they charge the official into the last check of all the lost control to realise what he has done.
That's the worst part.
I was even with him on one control ride, which I learned subsequently from their roster.
Several months have passed since publishing the last parts of the series.
What's the response?
I think especially in foreign viewers, before the series is the most focused.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I give them the videos.
And then, when we walk down the Starocity Square, it's a surprise that the same people who are seen in the footage are really standing.
The infamous Prague celebs.
But seriously.
I'd build a diaper around them so people would look at them.
The Museum of Communism right on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a cab when you need to?
Oh, yeah.
I ride services that I don't have to pay in cash, but by card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many dispatchers that are fair.
I've taken a taxi on the street from that time just once.
The driver said to me after taking the car, you've got the courage.
Dressed in disguise for an Italian tourist.
It was written about the fraudulent practices of the taxi industry in 2005.
In the same year, the former Mayor, Paul Bally, headed out for a tour in disguise for Italy's tourist, and at the first attempt, the driver cheated him two hundred.
But the editor of Rubek had a worse experience.
Taxi drivers charged him for driving from Starocity to Wenceslas Square 820, which is based on about $195 per kilometre, as calculated by the makers of the story.
The Prague Municipality has set a maximum price to £28 per kilometre.
There are also other surprising sums in the videotaped report: For example, a two-mile journey from the streets of Paris to the Trusts cost the tourist 400 kronor.
The expensive rides were provided by taxi drivers waiting at Charles Bridge.
For the ride on the Angel, which has 2.5 kilometres, they also charge six hundred crowns.
Marble is mostly pure water, the most without chemistry, and the longer, the better.
The impurities are going well, although sometimes the dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it needs to be gouged out of the folds.
It's not easy, and it's not coming fast, it has brought her work to the restaurateur of Vanesa Trostova from Oldichova in the Grove.
Hat down in front of her: A tombstone is surrounded by scaffolding, which must be climbed up and down a few times.
A Singaporean restaurateur should be meticulous, patient and non-violent on the working environment, 'she said.
This is hardly the first of her restaurateur's work on Frýdrovsk.
Through it, for example, the restoration of the stone elements of the facade in the back of the floured town hall, the statue of Saint Mary Magdalene in the West, St. John Nepomuk in Frýdland, Pieta in the Frýdland, or the Atlantic, in the Frýdland, or the Atlantic, in the New York City of New York, has also been restored.
With the restored tombstone of Melchior, Christopher and Catherine of Redern, it began in Frýdland in 2011.
Now, clearing the surface of the stone elements from the nose of the impurity and the crust, the loose stone parts shall be secured against the fall and drift; either they are anchored to the wall or to one another.
There is also the treatment and preservation of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be re-latched.
Pioneering the Potome will begin by gilding the inscriptions on the marble plates of the engraving gold, the defender 'said the report of the state's memorial service to the city's office in Frýdlant Vera Sobotka.
There are no records from the past that the tombstone has gone through some repairs.
On a closer look, they take openings, paraded in marble columns.
They are hundreds of years old and it's about the remains after the decoration of the tombstone.
He was richly adorned, unfortunately, after a raid by the Swedes for the Thirty Years War all disappeared.
Literally, the tombstone was combed, Sobotka noted.
In the church of Naleing St Cross, restaurateurs are with a slight pitch as at home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to put the tombstones under water, restoration of the quake, the murals in the tomb, and now the tombstone.
We would also be embarking on the vitriol in the future in the future, Singaporeans told Sobotka.
The church is otherwise in very good shape, every year into maintenance and repairs putting in money.
Restoration work to restore the reigning tombstone will cost a total of $128,000.
They will be covered in subsidies, the city will not be putting any of its money into this part of the recovery.
One hundred thousand crowns will go just from a win in the regional round of competition by the Historical City of 2015, the remaining £28,000 is then the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, advanced by the mayor of Frýdland's Dan Ramzer.
The release of the prize on the restoration of the tombstone has been decided by the trustees.
The views of experts on future developments in selected foreign markets followed by indexes and comparisons with the Czech capital market - LRB- PX -RRB- within one month and a half year.
Low volatility and growth prevails in markets.
Who would have said that in the beginning of the year.
The US-based S & P500, which went through 12% of the correction in February, is now at a new historic peak and has added 7 per cent since the start of the year.
Again, the iron rule is that traders should never go against the interest of central banks, which in the end have always achieved their own.
In a situation where US stocks are at a historic peak, the volatility that is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets have been complacent, and without fear have grown through the quantitative easing of the US central bank, and when, as today, the volatility of -LRB- VIX -RRB- has held steady below 12 per cent.
And neither should he.
Although the Fed continues to prepare for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative easing in Europe and Japan is in full swing, and, in the past week, the Bank of England, which will buy bonds in the size of 70 billion pounds, has also been in full swing in the past week.
So a new round of quantitative easing is pushing already low yields even lower, contributing to a near-complete elimination of the risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That is, of course, a matter of a million.
But there are no risks at the moment, the world economy is going through near-constant growth, with no major swings, the commodity market situation, and China's stabilizing and brexit is no longer an issue, so we shouldn't be too surprised if US stocks continue to stand in a similarly calm regime.
Too bad Juncker's not studying Klaus!
I am delighted that my friend Michel Barnier has taken this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult job, the head of the European Commission, Juncker, said, when the French politician - LRB- really experienced, for passing through so many various transnational political functions that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to find - RRB- appointed the European Commission's chief negotiator of the conditions of Britain's exit from the EU.
Juncker's selection blew out hints of the hope that it was in the serious interest of the EU to seek out Britain's forms of future-friendly coexistence.
However, most British media have adopted the name of Barnier as Juncker's war act.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
He hates the great Britain.
As the Eurocommissioner for the internal market - LRB- 2009 - 2014 - RRB- was in charge of reforming European banking rights.
He conceived it as he could only contain it: The hardened enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of free market and the model of capitalism.
The proponent of multilateral regulation was the co-author of the concept of the so-called banking union, and, in spite of everything from the City of the City of London, has pushed through legislation to overcome the hard-line regulation of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the leader of Paris in dispute with London, will be a tough, unflinching, and apparently reckless negotiator.
That's probably not good news.
How not to remember the calm and friendly division of the Czechoslovak federation in this context, to which they have contributed so much to the balance sheet, the overview, and the ability to empathise with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
That is why, today, Czechs may be closest to friends and allies.
Too bad Juncker has learned nothing from Vaclav Klaus - at least in this.
It would be for all of them!
An Earthquake Around Putin?
The Kremlin ruler dismissed his close friend Ivan.
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed Sergei Ivanov from the post of the head of the presidential office on Friday.
His whereabouts will be taken by Anton Vajno.
The Russian media has been informed of the announcement by the Kremlin's press service.
In doing so, Putin suggested that Ivanov was deserting his own request.
In a meeting carried by television station Rossiya 24, the president said he was coming to meet the desire of Ivan's pronouncements in taking office, that he wanted to be head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report on the exchange at the head of the president's administration, which will now lead Ivanov's past representative Vajno, is seen as relatively surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63, is described as one of Putin's closest aides.
This former KGB officer in the past, for example, has been acting as Secretary of Defense and Deputy Prime Minister.
He will now also leave the chair of a member of the president's security council.
Ivanov, at the meeting with Putin, however, said that it was the length of staying at the head of the state's chief of government, in fact, a record holder.
He lasted four years and eight months.
In this connection, he recalled that 11 people had already been replaced in the 25 years since it was established.
The Quite or the Deputies of the Strength with the Shockers won't play the finals.
So far, neither of the pair's tennis matches has been able to turn into a finals attendance.
As the first of her battle she lost to Petra Kvitova, who succumbed to the Puerto Rican surprise of Mona Puig after sets 4-4, 6-1 and 3-6.
Kvitova, after a while, also followed the Czech dearth of Shooting with his uncle.
The slaying of the Williams sisters in the first set of the match, however, wasted two setbacks, and Rusky eventually captured the set in a shortened game.
The second set then lost by 4: 6.
Half the success in the finishing program in Rio was recorded by Czech rowing: Skier Andrew Synek, with the odds winning his semi-finals, when the second Damir Martin of Croatia defeated despite the election in the end by almost a second.
Today's good, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I was trying to save as much as possible, Synek said.
His opponents, unlike him, had to fight the procedure.
It might be easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing my cards, the Welsh Dukes said.
But Mirka Topina-Knapp did not walk in Snyder's footsteps.
The 35-year-old rowdy put in her fourth position in today's semi-final and is expecting her start in the B finals on Saturday and the battle for the 7th to 12th place.
He won't defend gold from London.
I didn't go to the Olympics for the first time in the Olympics.
I'm a little bit sorry, but on the other hand I was riding a good race and I put everything I could into.
The contenders were simply better, Topinka Knapk leaned in front of them.
She fought to the end and believed she would get on her fourth game among the elite six.
She gave up the fight just before the goal.
I knew the girls were balanced, that anybody could move the field.
I was surprised by the Chinese woman that she had such finesse.
And I thought I could go to the finals.
Unfortunately, she was riding a life race today, the 2011 world champion said.
Far beyond the final gates in Rio, the young marksman Philip Nepechal, who has not even been cleared of qualifying for the second time, has been in the woods for a second time.
In it, he took 33rd place in it.
The best qualified for the Russians.
From the first rung, Sergei Kamensky advanced with 629 points, from the other Kirill Grigorjan-LRB- 628,9 -RRB-.
The puppy's shot was worth 620.5 points.
Athletes in Rio for the first time were also spoken to, including Czech seven-timers Catherine Cacho and Efox Klux.
Cachs are ranked 11th in the second time of the Olympic competition, the Czech record holder Efox Kludo is twenty-two.
She leads Briton Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimetres as well as an ongoing second Belgian Nafissatou Thiam.
Both have taken on the historically best high-altitude performance in the seven-fight.
They were still trying to jump 201 inches, but they failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
When we look away from the absurdity of such a question: The German society has undergone a deep self-reflection, while Russian does not.
In the two great Eurasian nations, there were dictators in the 20th century, and regimes that were inhuman, brutal, and terrible came to power.
The Russian Bolsheviks from 1917 to 1989 contributed a great deal to the 94 million victims of communism, which depicts the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent leadership of war, or non-human experimentation.
The Nazis indiscriminately wiped out around 6 million Jews, and the total victims of World War II are estimated at 60 million.
The Germans and the Soviets were conducting atrocities on manned or leaving territories.
Few individuals were guilty in Germany or the USSR, but a large proportion of the nation participated in these crimes, whether actively, passive, or simply cowardly or sticking their heads in the sand.
This is not the specifics of these nations, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany immediately ending the war came denacification, the Nuremberg tribunal.
But the most important came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask: Father, grandfather, why did you participate in such atrocities?
How could you?
That brought real reflection and cure to society.
Until recently, Germany's elites cared mainly about the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the well-being of its citizens.
Now they have other-LRB- often naively idealistic -RRB- targets, but they're certainly not going to be able to attach it back to Alsace-Lorraine or anyone - to revanse - militarily attack - that may be accepted by everyone.
After the lost Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes has finally closed at the turn of the millennium when a former KGB officer - LRB- sic! - Vladimir Putin came to power.
The often criminal past is being celebrated in Russia today.
The politics of Russia's putrefaction is revanchism, the conquest of lost territory, the degradation of the West.
Health, prosperity, and the future of their own people are no value to the faithful.
Beat your own, and the others will be afraid.
I still believe that this is just the decades of despotic regime that Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - destined for the Asian-LRB- self-tyranny.
Who benefits from rising tensions around Crimea?
Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours there has been a worsening of the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the area of Crimea.
Who benefits from growth?
After a longer period of relative calm, there has been a further deterioration in the relationship between Ukraine and Russia.
The pretext of the Ukrainian side has become a peninsula in Crimea, which was annexed more than 2 years ago to Russia and is part of its territory.
Of course, reports from both abusive parties are contradictory, and it is difficult to verify them independently, and so do we have the opportunity to just consider the old familiar question of who benefits?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which understandably Ukraine rejects and, on the other hand, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
Information about the arrest of Ukrainian special forces troops on Russia's territory has already come from the case of pilot Savchenko's known response that they had reportedly been kidnapped in Russia's territory.
If we acceded to the Ukrainian version, what would Russia benefit from the deterioration in the Crimea situation?
The simple answer is nothing.
Escalating tensions around Crimea can only hurt Russia, especially from the West in the form of further attracting sanctions and strengthening the anti-Russian campaign.
Last year, there was a backdrop of the immigration crisis to Europe to withdraw attention from the situation in Ukraine.
Ukraine's leadership lost its full credit before its citizens, when current support for President Poroshenko is around 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have been bankrupt long ago if not for generous financial injections by the EU and mostly the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to draw attention again to its country to justify its further requests for financial assistance and try to improve reputations for voters in their country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the force's leadership again want to be shown as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
One hopes that all those attempting to unleash the open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually recognize their huge responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers, but of all ordinary people on both sides, and stop their hostile actions in a timely manner.
Bulgaria for the first time in eight months reported inflation
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate reached 1% in Bulgaria in July.
This is the highest value in several years -LRB- since June 2012 -RRB- and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI index, over the last 12 months of -LRB- August 2015 - July 2016 -RRB- compared with the previous period of 12 months -LRB- August 2014 - July 2015 -RRB- was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016, compared to June 2016, was 101.0%, the monthly inflation rate was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the start of the year -LRB- July 2016 versus December 2015 -RRB- was -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, there was an increase in the travel of these groups of consumer goods: Food and non-alcoholic drinks - LRB- 1.7% -RRB-, right -LRB-, the culture and recreation of -LRB- 6.3% -RRB-, restaurants and hotels -LRB- 1.2% -RRB-, other goods and services -LRB- 0.3% -RRB-.
The fall in prices occurred in clothing and footwear -LRB- 2.2% -RRB-, furniture, household equipment and routine maintenance -LRB- 0.5% -RRB-, health -LRB- 0.1% -RRB-.
At the same level as the previous month, prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuel, communication and education have remained at the same level as the previous month.
The US Secret Service said the year was followed by the hacking attacks by the Russians.
Information about the Russian attacks came to the public last month, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation - LRB- - RRB- announced it was investigating the attack on the party's headquarters for Democrats.
But there is no official mention of the Russian stake in the attack.
Moscow has denied involvement in the attack.
The report on the surveillance of the alleged Russian attack was top-secret, as it would be clear that the US secret service was monitoring the hacking attack and revealing it could be the way they do and what resources they use.
Two Russian intelligence services were involved in the attack.
A new advisory force for cyber security
The material to track the Russian footprint was eroded and access to it was just a small group of experts, Reuters wrote.
Only a small group of eight leading members of Congress, called the US gang of eight, have been informed of public officials.
It is made up of the bosses of both chambers Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the Democrats in both chambers of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and four members of the House and Security Committees of Congress.
Acting head of the Democratic Party, Donna Brazile, on Thursday announced that it was creating an advisory force for cybersecurity, which has apologised to prevent future attacks and to secure top-level protections for the Democratic Party's servers.
There was a dangerous parasite in the smoked salmon from Alberta.
The chain apologized.
On the basis of the consumer's complaint on health problems after the consumption of food salmon wild smoked - pieces 100 g, the date of consumption of 22.11.2016 has been carried out by the Prague Health Inspectorate in the Albert Square and on the Bridge.
The check found that the lot of L23012562 favouritism @ T4, with the date of consumption of 22.11.2016, to which the customer pointed out was no longer available, and therefore removed the product of the same batch with a date of consumption of 11.12.2016.
The laboratory examination has been confirmed by the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
This is a parasitic worm digestive tract of marine mammals.
This is dangerous for humans - larvae in the body cavity or the muscle of the fish are a potent allergen, and the man-made living larvae can penetrate the stomach wall into the internal organs, the haut said.
Customers are very sorry for the problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the batch, and for precautionary reasons, we withdrew all other batches of this item.
The misconduct took place on the part of the supplier we are dealing with, and at the same time we have allowed this product to be tested, said newspaper spokesman Albert Barbara Vanko.
If a customer has bought this product, it can return it in any of the stores of the chain and get the money back.
The larvae will destroy the frost as well as adequate heat treatment
The seller was Nekton-Roads.
On the occurrence of a hazardous product, the hygienists informed the Prague and centre-based veterinary administration.
According to the safety of the food, people after ingesting the parasite can fall ill with anisakiosis, which will take severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can take place without symptoms, QTK said.
Symptoms occur an hour or two weeks after eating undercooked infected fish.
After three weeks from the start, larvae usually spontaneously leaves the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to higher and low temperatures, which is why they are killed either in sufficient heat treatment of fish meat, or at freezing.
The veterinarians currently inspected the salmon as well as the recipient of the imported goods in the Mediterranean.
Three of the five samples were taken in the parasite.
The shipment of 1700 products came to the Czech Republic by the State Veterinary Administration - LRB- JRC -RRB in early April.
Shipped out, in the vast majority in the Attribute chain, was a 9-19 pack to date.
There is currently a download of unsold stock of the product from the outlets, a spokesman for the JRC, Petr Pejchal, said on Friday.
Veterinarians immediately after finding positive samples were banned from sending other products from the warehouse.
A 17-year-old Briton wanted to flee the Rakhine, killing her apparently by a Russian raid.
After the initial enthusiasm and rapid marriage to the jihadist who was killed soon, she was sober.
The expected paradise of the chalet for British girls turned to hell on the ground from which there was no escape.
The girl was in contact with her sister Halima, according to relatives.
She had repeatedly phoned her in Britain and told him she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They have an order not to shoot, quoting The Telegraph of the family of the late girl Tasnim Akunjee.
The last tracks led to Rakka, the last time the girl spoke.
Then there was only news of her death, but that could not be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in east London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of the Cancer and cross the Turkish border.
That's where they hoped to meet the former student again.
But Kadiza was likely killed before she could flee because the house, in which she was delayed, compared the country in May, the British ITV News reported.
Television added that the bomb appeared to have toppled Russian aircraft, which was attacking the bastion of IS in Syria.
You would take the blue out of the sky just to get your child out of the dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, the family's lawyer.
In the week, when -LRB- Kadiza-RRB- thought of escaping from Islamic State territory, an escape was captured by one of the Austrians and, according to the available information, was publicly beaten to death.
I think that - LRB- Kadiza -RRB- interpreted as a warning and decided not to take any risks, misses by BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlanao, along with 15-year-old friends at Shamima Begum and Amirou Abasa, went on the road on February 17 last year.
At home, they just said they were going out.
But they headed for Gatwick airport and from it across Turkey into territory controlled by IS.
The family of the girl, according to the lawyer, was doing everything in her power to get Kadizu back.
You would take the blue out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area and this family did everything she could, straining all the power to get her daughter home.
But it wasn't possible without risking themselves being caught, the lawyer added.
The only positive thing is that Kadizy's fate may serve as a deterrent to other girls or even boys who are left to fool the Islamist propaganda.
Chilling VERDICT There are many cases where people have gone there, aware of how things are there, understood how far it is different from the promises of the Islamic State propaganda, and they wanted to come back, the comedian 'stated further to Akunjee.
The fate of Kadiz's classmates is not known.
But since they were also silent, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to bars without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the village of Inveraray was the city centre and the seat of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the mid-18th century, courts have been held at City Hall, and the basement has served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts had survived were pitiful, and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them and successfully.
That's why city officials have decided to move the areas of the prison to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was more welcoming to the prisoners, had heating and gas lighting.
Either way, it had not been in operation for a long time, for its conclusion, for economic reasons, by the end of August 1889, as the smaller remedies were expensive to operate, and it did not pay much.
The story of convicts and the hunt for ghosts.
For the public, the prison opened up a century later, visitors can compare the old building with a new one to convince themselves how different conditions were in them.
The Wizards in good costumes are amplified by the authentic experience.
There is also an agonising room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishment have been applied to criminals, whether it was breaking their fingers or burning brands onto the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be locked into one of the cells, mostly because of a photo in remembrance, or to get the feeling behind bars experiencing the prisoners.
In addition, the Inveraray prison is one of the most famous Scottish sites where it is alleged to be haunted.
There have already been several groups of paranormal activity, and this museum allows people to hunt down some ghosts.
Such a night, however, will be up to £300, which is worth around £9500.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, commuters are also attracted to great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
Colombian giveaways' effect on Snapchat is criticised as Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by the animation, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
Every day, Snapchat allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with identity that borders on the absurd.
You can make a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that seems to have stepped out of Roy Lichtenstein's image.
Filters are simple tools that defy reality and generate more than 30 million improved piglets every day.
Any mistake will be published immediately.
The Snapchat filters in the past have served criticism with accusations that the application promotes blackfacing or that it promotes white shades of skin as an ideal of beauty.
So when this week, users offered a filter through which they had slanted eyes, distorted teeth and inflated faces, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - Singaporeans' yellowface.
And they asked if these repeated contentious issues did not point to a larger problem of society - a problem with diversity.
On Wednesday, the Verge and the motherboard wrote, and the news and outrage spread quickly, and Snapchat said on the next day that he had cancelled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a manifestation of the accounts of the characters animated, not as a caricature of Asians.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded painful stereotypes in action.
Others without the cover comparison with the animations refused.
Grace Sparapani, a student of the American art from Korea whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was homemade at least harmful and embarrassing.
She added that Singaporeans are hard to argue against comparing the obvious Asian caricatures and the effects of the filter.
It turns out that the filter is not just about the yellow face of -LRB- the yellowface -RRB- but that the yellow face is touched down to the scorching extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has exceeded these cultural limits.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, from meeting halls in corporations to Holywood and equipment that we all wear in hand.
And a huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their senior partners - may be expecting even more sensitivity.
Chilling VERDICT When one filter Snapchat creates a picture that is offensive to one user, said the 25-year-old Katie Zhuo on Thursday in an interview, exquisitely very hard to make these things go unnoticed today, as it was before.'
Katie Zhuo, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided to delete her account on Snapchat on Thursday and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in an interview on the phone, she said she believes that racially motivated problems reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment of workers in Snapchat.
Katie Zhuo criticised the overwhelmingly white, completely male management of the company and the article ended with a hash tag: # DeleteSnapchat.
Explaining the scam It's either that they don't have any diversity and colourful people at the moment to decide on these things, the comedian said Zhuo, who has Chinese-American origin, giveaways or coloured people working, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to talk.
Other observers share her view - a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not disclose figures relating to the diversity of its employees with the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to talk about the racial origins of its employees, but, according to a spokesman, the company recently adopted a recruitment worker to focus on the underrepresented population and the internal management of insiders.
Zhuova adds: Workout quiz I'm curious to see if they really need more of those users who can say it's not OK, texting to keep their account cancelled.
Army officers sparked intelligence information about IS, says parliamentary committee
A parliamentary committee in a report issued on Thursday said that officers from the United States Central Command had been changing the intelligence service's report to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iranium and in Syria than what was provided by the events from the country.
According to a preliminary report by the working group drawn up by the Republican chairman of the House Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Committee, there was a setback to the widespread discontent of the broadcaster's central intelligence services, according to which their superiors measured their assessment of the US effort to defeat the Islamic State.
The central headquarters, known as CentCom, is the Army Central in Tampa in Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
In a press release to the report, the report states: Broadcaster News of intelligence secret services approved by senior officers in Centcom typically offered a more positive picture of the US counter-terrorism efforts than have been confirmed on the ground, and were consistently more positive than the analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community.
Footage VERDICT What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are damaged when the superior policy makers are presented with a faulty analysis, the defender said of Ken Calvert, a congressman and a Republican from California.
Failure in command of Centcom extends to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the continuing problems of the central staff in the description and analysis of US efforts in the training of Iranian forces in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no decisive evidence that the Obama administration's top officials have ordered the news to be amended, it says in a report that analysts had the impression that they were by leaders of Centcom under pressure to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
Footage premiere In the first half of 2015, there were many press reports by the Central Staff, a statement and testimony from Congress significantly more positive than what the events actually were, the transcript said in the report.
For example, a representative of Centcom publicly declared that a major military assault to take Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second-largest city of Iran, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
Footage critic This is completely clear after months of the investigation, Capt. Mike Pompeo, a representative of the Republican Party from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, they had been manipulated by senior intelligence agencies of the US Central Staff with the outcomes of intelligence services to downplay the dangers of IS in the Iranium.
Republicans have set up a task force after learning about the concerns of analysts about the information intelligence services relating to the Islamic State are being manipulated.
After the report published on Thursday, more detailed scrutiny must be followed after further investigation.
There is yet another investigation conducted in the intelligence services of Centcom, led by the Department of Defense's inspector general.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of a working group of Republicans.
Footage premiere Between 2014 and 2015 Centcom created a very narrow process for compiling the assessment of information about IS and the Iranian security forces, the defender said in a statement representing Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the House Committee and deputy Democrats.
In the words of Adam Schiff, this process of giveaways led to the reversal of the outcomes of the intelligence services, the critic 'damaged the morale among analysts and the Singaporeans inadequately taken into account the dissenting views.'
However, Schiff and Democrats argue that they have found no evidence that the White House was attempting to push the Centcom analysts to adjust their findings according to the giveaways of the draft or the political situation.
Preliminary results of the parliamentary inquiry were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general, which was launched after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander-in-chief Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence's parliamentary report would not comment, as the inspector general's investigation is still continuing.
But he said that Singaporean experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of comprehensive data, and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence are seeing a healthy dialogue regarding these crucial questions of national security.
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing in Iranium and Syria is a successful -LRB- statement, which now claims a growing number of defense officials - RRB-.
However, last year's allegations raised question marks about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central staff to genuinely evaluate military operations in Iran, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis places.
Criticism of the news about the Islamic State reflects conflicts for more than a decade since intelligence analyst Centcom Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper in which it was reported that President George W. Bush's administration - despite the objections of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iranium and devoted little time to thinking about what would be followed by the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in opposition to the Islamic State's intelligence services.
Last year, authorities announced that Hooker's team had concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, aerial strikes conducted against the Islamic State's refineries did not weaken the financial resources of this terrorist group since the group built temporary refineries and oil sold on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings had not been passed away from the central staff.
The commander of Centcom, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then subjected to criticism of the past year after many lawmakers found the testimony of the Senate too positive for the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced in Centcom by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The US prevailed in ground hockey in the fourth game in a row, so today it will be a crucial match in the United Kingdom's team
Katie Bound in the match against Japan, who ended up winning 6-1, shot three tackles and just a day after the American women's ground hockey team shot the first two overs of a game in which America beat India 3-0 on Thursday.
Five tackles in two matches is a success worthy of remembering, but Bama-LRB- 27-RRB- said she's not sure if she ever did anything like that.
Adorable prank I have no idea, fiancee said.
I am not one of those who write down their business.
But this knows: The American in the Olympic tournament lead to matches 4-0 and split first place in the group with Great Britain, which remained undefeated on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2-0.
Great Britain and the United States clash on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have qualified for the quarter-finals, and the game will decide which of the group's six teams will finish on the first and who in second place.
The team from first place will take a little longer to make strong Danes, who are on the lead of the second group.
Whatever Saturday's game ends, Americans here have caused a stir here, four years after they finished among 12 teams at the Games in London.
Bamo was in that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and a field hockey team took the first time in her hand when she was 3 years old - LRB- her older sister twins played in the Drexel-RRB - and she entered the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest ever player at all.
The 2008 Olympics escaped her because she didn't get on the final roster.
Then came the year 2012, when the power failed even her, or members of her team.
Another year, the coach was appointed Englishman Craig Parnham and things started to change.
Embracing the Cultural Change, mental change, physical change, Singaporean said Bama.
We didn't have that work rate in London as we have today.
We did a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bama launched a shotgun blast from the vicinity in the first half.
India entered the game without victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the third quarter, when Bama took the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then flicked through on Wednesday and shot the ball into the gate to get the American woman to lead 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last gate in the middle of the fourth quarter.
Dismissing the goalkeeper of the Americas, Jackie Briggs, who helped one goal in each of the three victories, was the first in the tournament.
He's in great shape.
Just like Bama.
Congrats Now we're in a good place, hooker 'said Parnham, but how good it is, that will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Zen trampolines amid Olympic rampage
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - it's the Olympics.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro, it smells of persistent, indescribable and biased rotation of competition and effort.
It's how the Olympic torch itself would be a hot shooter's peg handed over from a bowler of swimmers, a gymnast and a triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in a coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chade le Close.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming darling of women with dimples in their faces, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names are recorded in households in the main broadcasting time between the advertising and spots of sponsors if he was a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley-LRB- 28-RRB- of Lake Forest in California is fighting for Olympic gold in jumps on a trampoline.
The Olympic fire doesn't shine on all competitions anyway.
Farther from the centre, a little in the shade are sports that are not widely recognised: Gunfire from airguns, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and will probably rule for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favourite, let me draw attention to the subtle magic of the trampoline.
Though the jumps on the trampoline Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first featured in the Sydney Games, it remains almost unnoticed after 16 years of interventions - many of the people I interviewed didn't even know it was an Olympic sport.
It can be a regional indifference.
The US has never won a medal in the jumps on the trampoline and, until 2012, none of the athletes got even to the finals.
Prices in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia, and in the women's category between China and Canada.
This year, gold medals from London will be embraced by Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
But leaps on the trampoline have yet another pitch, partly because the ear of the outsider will seem more suited to a clown college than the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, but only an enthusiast watching from the ground.
It has the comic potential - the comic's vibration of the endless bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports that combine in one another.
The word 'homemade trampoline' is derived from the Spanish homemade kangaroo trolley 'which means' homemade kangaroo slab '.
The aspiring champions are jumping on a huge trampoline that launches them to a height of up to almost 10 metres and show reports with several elements of -LRB- salta, vruty and a combination of -RRB- before finally landing on their legs again.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are rated according to implementation, difficulty and scoring a time in the air.
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic trajectory is forward.
The battle for gold medals must go on, faster and higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes there and back, up and down.
They are trying to catch up not only the target band or the starting wall, but as the television news shows, also another poignant line: The world or Olympic record.
This unanimous endeavor is noble, admirable, a bit fanatical - and enough to bring viewers to tears.
But I think it's a bit exhausting at the same time when you're watching the Olympics.
Jumps on trampolines in this respect provide relief.
The trajectory of an athlete on a trampoline is upwards.
The point is not moving forward.
He or she reflects, as if they were in a state without weight as astronauts, going up, then down, then again effortlessly up.
Without competition and, of course, not difficult, but for the duration of the report, there is no fierce struggle to achieve the goal, no reward distance, but just a perfect, graceful spring of time and gravity.
This is the closest thing the Olympics will ever get.
The qualifications and finals of the women take place on Friday afternoon, at 13 p.m. Eastern Time, the men's competition then on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will be the final broadcast in the afternoon bloc, which begins after both days at 14 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic frenzy, they promise a quiet, enjoyable moment that you probably overlook the other struggles.
And if the attention is only to be achieved, male athletes will be the subject of love-related glances and materializations - as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested to the gymnasts of the US - then Logan Dooley is merely waiting for his new fans gasping for breath.
Singaporeans protesters generation of Singaporeans in Ethiopia, long-time allies of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have been hit by a violent backlash from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot during clashes with police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a fast-growing economy.
Over the past few months, however, the country has been engulfed in anti-government unrest spreading to more and more areas.
Just over the last week, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding major policy changes.
Under human rights organizations, the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses say the police shot and killed crowds of unarmed protesters.
On the circulating video recordings of the protests that come probably from the end of last year or the start of this year, they are captured by members of the security forces as they beat young people hookers after they were forced to stand by the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
Wearables Always have been difficult to keep this country together and to make the step forward will be even harder, Singaporeans said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for research group International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with Ethiopians to eliminate the threat of terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and few of the African countries, if any, are getting such help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has evolved at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has significantly improved - in the capital of Addis Abeba, there is even a new commuter train.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia can be seen as a model of democracy - a human-rights organization without constant talk of government repression - opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many have been denounced, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this may change.
Sneak peek When people are suffocating and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breach, the kangaroo told Seyoum Teshome, who lectures at the university in central Ethiopia.
It protests all young people.
He's been protesting for generations.
Complaints are many and concern everything from disputes over land to absolute control of the ruling coalition's power.
After last year's election, which has been widely criticised, the ruling party and its allies have won the last seat held by the opposition, and now controls 100 per cent in parliament.
At the same time, there is increasing pressure on the border with Eritrea, and the conflict along this inaccurately marked, disputed border has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Anylitigants fear that separatist groups, which have been more or less suppressed over the past years, such as the Oslo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why, after years of smouldering beneath the surface, these bitter feelings have reignited.
The first is seemingly harmless: Smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks through the past few years, when they have become commonly available cheaper smart phones and improved Internet service provision.
And while the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as it normally happens primarily during the protests, many people can still communicate via the internet proxy that hides the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke of how they were gathering in protest.
There is also greater solidarity between Oromy and Amhary, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Oroma and Amhar are not natural allies.
For the long ages of Amhar, largely from the Christian Hills of Ethiopia, they excelled in politics and trade, and used the Oromy, of which many Muslims are and live in the plains.
But that's changing, too.
Stepping up We are on our way to a united leadership, a defender 'said Mulatu's Gemech, the leader of the Oroms.
The biggest protests took place in areas occupied by Amhary and Oromy.
Many Amhares and Oromes believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the ethnicity of Tigraj, which accounts for around 6 per cent of the population and controls the military, intelligence services, trade and policy.
The third reason for unrest is the death of Melese Zenawi.
Zenawi, an earlier rebel leader, was the Ethiopian chairman of the government for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to unlisted illnesses.
He was regarded as a tactical genius, for a man who could see a corner.
Analysts say a particularly mistrial has been able to detect initial signs of discontent and have used the envoys to keep the opponents from processing and gaining on his side.
Deeply flawed The current regime lacks the basic knowledge, the defender 'said Abdi, an analyst of the conflict.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been pulled from relative unfamiliarity with the aim of replacing Zenawia.
Unlike Zenawii, who came from the Tigraya region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam came from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security services controlled by the Tigreans.
Many fear that there will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such riots in 2005 was when thousands of people protested what analysts had described as elections that the government had screwed up and then stole.
He followed a hard hit, during which many protesters were killed - though less than in recent months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised the leaders of Ethiopia for visionary infrastructure planning, what a new commuter train is, and measurable progress in combating poverty.
But it is abundantly clear that the gradual mounting of disputes within the Ethiopian government has not stopped it.
And there's a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the Amsterdam city of Gondar attacked commercial firms owned by Tigreans and resentment against Tigreys on social networks is becoming increasingly common.
Analysts say the protests are putting in an awkward situation for the US and other Western allies.
The US government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although recently it said the base had been closed.
While the West wants to promote democracy unequivocally, it does not want its ally in an already volatile region to fall apart.
Footage transcript That, defender 'said Abdi, scoring a very sharp edge.
Donald Trump explains his verdict on Obamacare and funding IS as homemade sarcasm givea'
Donald J. Trump, on Friday, attempted to downplay the latest controversy flooding his campaign, saying he didn't mean it when he insisted several times this week that Presidents Obama and Hillary Clinton were Singaporeans founder of the Singaporean Islamic State group.
The explanation has raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to talk to the American public.
He also puts his supporters in an awkward position, defending him hard at times, and having to explain that he may not have been serious about his remarks.
Following that proposal at a meeting on Wednesday, Trump's statement on Thursday confirmed and in interviews he insisted that he really had no intention of saying that the president and H. Clinton were created.
However, in a Twitter feed on Friday morning, Trump declared he was merely being sarcastic.
The post was a repeat of the claims of the old one day, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump's remark by easing the reminder that Obama is seeking to destroy IS, the Republican presidential candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes as Trump attempted to focus his campaign on the economy, while his preferences in the polls are falling.
Trump and Clinton participated in Michigan's dugout on economic issues this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to this issue.
On Twitter, he warned again that Clinton's proposals were linked to tax increases, and said that, according to him, her speech was boring.
Trump used a defence of sarcasm earlier.
At the end of July, when he harvests a wave of criticism when he stepped down with a suggestion that the Russians should be able to reach out to the emails of Clinton, his remark was later explained by the words: Tears.'
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of policy statements and moderate them as required.
Explaining the scoring I think it's his way of testing the extent to which some of the messages resonate with his supporters to find out the way they respond, and, according to the reaction, then, one or the other way, the Singaporeans gave an explanation for the prank, said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who followed the language the two candidates used.
But I also think he is skilled in his pronouncements and knows that they are vague enough to explain differently.
Because the results of the polls in his favor continue to decline, Trump has taken a more mocking tone in recent days, rather than tempered things for the general electorate.
A new survey by NBC franchise @ Wall Street Journal critic critic @ Marist, which was published on Friday, showed that the tump is with a big margin for Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Kolorada, and very close behind her in Florida.
Trump is even trying to avoid apologizing for the provocative statements he says, but he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humour.
But, together with how Trump is facing increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put the jokes in the uncomfortable situation of his devoted supporters, who must stand behind him, however provocative he is.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, an earlier mayor of the city of New York, who is one of the most prominent Trump followers, had to defend the candidate Thursday in an interview with CNN.
Explaining to the Home Office that what he says is a legitimate political comment, the critic 'stated Giuliani when he was asked about the credibility of Trump's claims that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That is true in the sense that, before Obama, IS was almost unknown, a small organization that he mistakenly called a novice, and it was because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are attempting to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton acted as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, has allowed IS to drum up and fail to manage the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday's gathering in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to press on Twitter around the media for ruminating every word of his word and are intrigued by it.
He laughed tearfully to the poor, pathetic prank 'television scholars who tried to understand him, and he said' They can't do this.'
Several Democrats have apologised to Trump's apology, saying it was just further evidence that he was not eligible for the presidency.
The cafe pushed out of the market, now returning to Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a shabby place in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, without WiFi, but where the coffee was served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was forced out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a deal that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - is selling soap-shaped soap.
The locals mourned the last loss of the growing city.
Artist Molly Crabappleke on Twitter wrote: Singaporean New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that the CBGB dead, the Chelsea-filled hotel, and from the Verb is now the business of soap. .'
But if New York change, then it's also re-discovery.
The restored Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts payment cards, but there are some of the original staff working there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is still good, too.
The manager of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original café, who is also the owner and executive director of the new venue.
He started in Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay the move to a new venue, he said he would do it with pleasure.
Rodriguez -LRB- 36-RRB- left a lot of things the way they were.
The VERB still has the same supplier of care and bought the same model of the espresso machine.
He even reused the lighting from the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with ham, egg and cheese and toppings, such as capers and fried onion.
You'll also find bowls of brown rice.
The cafe no longer gives a beer, but offers fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of original swabs.
Singaporeans Many original customers from Williamsburg also had to move groceries because of the prices, he said.
Last Sunday, there was one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveira.
Ms Oliveira-LRB- 34-RRB- lived in Williamsburg and went to the Verb Cafe often.
She was walking even then when the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she completely stopped drinking coffee for a while.
Footage critic I found that what I like is the coffee and the culture in Verba, the kangaroo said.
Now he drinks coffee again, but on that day, instead of his usual iced coffee, he gave himself a stirring chai, another newspaper.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has gone to Verb since 2003.
She comes before work and orders the same thing.
Sneak peek At quarter and eight here every day, as a watch, I come in and they're already preparing my sponge with everything and butter, poop 'he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr Rosenthal continues to order what he normally does, but sometimes he keeps bacon, eggs and ham on his catwalk.
Rodriguez said he was not sorry that the soap business took its old place.
The truth is that Soap Cherie owners have offered to make a special soap for Verb and use a filtered coffee from the cafe as an ingredient.
Confident scoring I think we could still use it, hooker 'said Rodriguez.
The traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have adopted the cafe well.
One of the new customers of the offer translated into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where his new neighbours would feel at home.
The new place still has other benefits.
The local fruit juice maker wants to flock to the bottle and sell the filtered coffee.
It offers the possibility for the cafe to spread to a neighbouring building.
Many customers are enough to get their old favourite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and when the cafe closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr Whitt says that when the cafe has opened, come in and have a coffee is like coming home.
Sneak peek I missed the scent, hooker 'said.
Depressive food from the time of the crisis - in Singaporean Square Meal Sculp'
Shortly after taking office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and had lunch.
The smorgasbord of President Roosevelt savaged the selected dishes of 5th Avenue, such as a patchwork of strawberries and maryland turtle soup.
But his menu on this day was more modest: Eggs on a devilish way in tomato sauce, potato puree and as a dessert of plum pudding.
Chilling Revelation It was an act of cooking solidarity with people who suffered, hooker 'said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: Tearful It was also a message to Americans how to eat.
A couple who live in Brooklyn Heights are dedicated to gastronomic history.
The latest book by Andrew Coea critic Chop Suey apologises' was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book Reveals' 97 Orchard Auctions' tells the life story of a residential home on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work of the Singaporean A Square Meal Auctions, which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed up cooking solidarity themselves and, with a reporter, met for dinner at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small treadmill in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane-LRB- 54-RRB- ordered a cream cheese sandwich and a sandwich with sesame olives, Andrew-LRB- 57-RRB- have given turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meat loaf, which, according to the couple, was excellent to talk about food during the crisis.
Adorable homemade Carbanners were a very popular critic ', Miss Ziegelman said.
He was selling peanut, liver and bean meatballs.
They made the ingredients and other cheap foods that set the ingredients.
Imagine the amount of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe grinned.
Spinach peas would lay in your stomach as lead, kangaroo said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was used in the buffet to eat what you ate.
The teams of women cooked for the workers from the farm and breakfast, lunch, and dinner served a freshly baked pie.
It was the Americans who sent food to the hungry Europeans during World War I, and the Square Meal Detectives watched in what ways the nation was dealing with the fact that it was suddenly not a country of abundance.
Footage transcript It was a time when food became a central, dreaded point for the American people, the kangaroo told Coe to explain why he and his wife had decided to write about it.
Equally feared was the new budget diet: It has spread the mystery food, such as carbs and food from castings, cascades as a bland giveaway an amazing way to take advantage of the leftovers, the comedian 'noted Ziegelman, as the chefs could hide the unaesthetic ingredients under a layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - after long years of the central point of American food - became an austerity-allocated luxury.
Strange shifts, which were meant to serve as caloric and nutritious fill, preferred to taste or even common sense in cooking.
During surveys for a book featuring recipes, Miss Ziegelman prepared a good meal from a baked onion filled with peanut butter.
Footage critic was not a popular addition to the evening table, hooker 'said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman emphasized: Ludicrously It was surreal.
Peanut butter with roast onion doesn't come together.
It was typical of a lot of household recipes.
As never before and never then, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the head of the federal office for the domestic economy between 1923 and 1943 - drove the country's eating habits.
They published prescriptions and articles in newspapers and magazines, prompting women to take over the reins of the budget, and hiccups, such as cream spaghetti with carrots, converted to taste food.
Book Photographer A Square Meal Reveals' is a celebration of historical delicacies.
First of all, the desserts arose in the response of the government to its hungry citizens, such as the pose of President Herbert Hoover and I would like to have a pie.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his childhood, he was dining like the selected millionaire he had become.
Footage critic likes to eat continental kitchens, such as fish with cucumber sauce, squid 'said Andrew Coe.
He ate in an almost convoluted room, wearing a tux.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, would not allow him to set an example in his own stomach.
As the book tells me, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who didn't care about the taste.
A series of eating habits from the time of the crisis subsided as the country relocated to its feet.
The legacy has remained in our constant exploration of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple says that while writing the book, they better understand the eating habits of the mother of Miss Ziegelman - perhaps why she couldn't throw out food.
Footage critic had a real fear of a waste of food, hooker 'said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman recalled: Lured by Lidem of her was wrong.
There was an accident with the wrecks.
When they were at Eisenberg's clean desks, she and Mr Coe pulled out a dessert prepared at home: A plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
Singaporeans Call him a plum cream, comedian 'said Ziegelman, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each reluctantly turned a spoon into a thick brown mass.
Surprisingly, it was wrong.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as a proper treasurer, he told his wife: Tearful Hoddle would be a bit of a seedy walkers.
Europeans: Migrants go for benefits.
Most of the refugees coming to Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians are making fun of themselves.
That's what they would look like, if we were filming them.
A group of Russian artists, called 2D Among Us, is making fun of their home country.
Using photoshopped, he creates a collage that jokingly shows what it would look like if the famous shows and movies were filmed in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to pay for the bulk of legal representation in the patent case against hepatitis C virus in Merck
A district court judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to commission fees for lawyers that arose in the process relating to the patent against hepatitis C virus manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, the judgment under which Gilead was to pay $200 million in damages due to a breach of the two patents of Merck in connection with the very successful drugs of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a federal judge found repeatedly anti-legal negotiations on the part of Merck, in addition to another lie under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman added to the file on Thursday that Gilead was entitled to waive charges that arose in connection with the representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which is dominated by the market for new-generation medicines against hepatitis C, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates from 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to be the owner of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, an active ingredient of drugs from Gilead.
US-backed military forces claim to have regained full control of the city's Manslaughter
Military units supported by the US have regained full control of the northern city of Manmisery near the border with Turkey after the last fighters of the Islamic State fled the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
Syria's democratic forces -LRB- SDF -RRB- now the city is combing through the departure of the rest of the group of militants who have been hiding in the city.
The forces freed over 2,000 civilians who were detained by the militants, told Reuters Sharfan Darwish of the SDF and the Military Council of Manmisery.
Footage Swimming City is now fully under our control, but we are still searching the footage, he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid the federal tax rate of 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton on Friday published her tax return for 2015, in which she says the presidential candidate for Democrats and her husband had $10.75 million in that year and took a real tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons gave $1 million to the charity, largely to the Clinton Foundation-LRB- Clinton Foundation-RRB-. Expresident Bill Clinton contributed to a joint cascade of $5.3 million for lectures, and former Secretary of State admitted income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for his book on his book about his tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's co-candidate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, published tax returns in 10 years.
They paid a real tax of 20.3 per cent in 2015.
Singaporeans Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a model of financial transparency, Singaporeans said in a statement to Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton with the campaign.
Against this, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and retreating from his earlier promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for candidates to publish their tax returns to the President of the US, even if the law does not oblige them.
Trump, a businessman from New York, and his lawyers cited an audit of the Tax Department's Department of Finance as a reason for his refusal to make tax returns.
Actress Reveals Your Move, Parenthood 'said an aide to Hillary Clinton's campaign on Twitter, and has campaigned on the tax returns of Democrat candidates.
Michael Cohen, a special Trump adviser, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to disclose the tax returns until the audits were completed.
According to Trump's critics, among whom the Republican candidate for president of the 2012 Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, they agree that his refusal raises questions about his net profit, contributions to charities, business dealings and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton performs strongly on the issue, and released a video on Friday in which she recalls how high-ranking Republicans on Trump are urging her tax returns to be published.
On Thursday, the question will be mentioned in his speech to economic issues in Michigan.
Singaporeans refuse to do what all other candidates for the presidency have done for decades - to publish their tax returns, Singaporeans said in front of people.
Politico said Trump had paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants who claim it could be the case at the moment.
Rates of federal tax have become an issue in the election of the president.
Clinton is advocating a rule named after billionaire Warren Bufett, which would ensure that everyone who makes more than $1 million in a year will pay a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet at a gathering of Clinton in Omaha, in the state of Nebraska, where Buffett's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, called for Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he also passed the IRS audit, and that Trump's fiancee was not afraid of the extortionate 'financial office, but the electorate.
Clinton's campaign released tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua in the state of New York, averaged a federal tax on average of 32 per cent and a combined tax of around 40.5 per cent on average between 2007 and 2014.
The Clinton Foundation's tax return for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, they make wages of just $100 in their income.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which the Clintons added income to dividends and interest rates of $109.

Condoms filled with chilli or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Environmentalists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from walking into human dwellings - throwing condoms filled with powder from the chilli.
This process worked and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the US environmental organisation The Nature Conservancy, is promoting this process and training volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania, using this non-violent procedure in four steps to protect their homes and crops without hurting animals.
Many of them used spears earlier in their defence.
Friday is the world day of elephants dedicated to protecting these animals.
Emotional REPORTER Since they have developed this... a set of tools, we have observed a change in behavior in these communities. People are much more confident that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without hurting them, the Treasurer's executive director, Honeyguide Damian Bell, said in a statement.
The first and second step is to shine a flashlight on the passing elephant and start the horn.
If it doesn't deter him, there will be an expulsion of the so-called homemade cloud of chilli squid.
Chilli powder mixed with salt with the petarda wraps up to the condom, its end is knotted so that only the wick can be seen from it.
After the launch, the condom will explode and a fine powder from the chilli is sprayed into the air.
Usually one whiff and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last resort is a fireworks launch that will provoke a loud, clear explosion.
Jewish director leaned back in Berlin hotel for removing code for calls to Israel to prank prank request by vigilante 'Arabs' - RT News
The French film's director of Jewish origin caused a stir in the media after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not have a code for calls to Israel, in the words of a staff member on the basis of a Singaporean request for Singaporean clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of a documentary about the Holocaust Relief Shoah Reveals', ventilated his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German journal FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the hotel code list.
But the state was not listed among the countries to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel has been removed and deleted?
He wrote Lanzmann.
Kempinski Bristol is instead offering a call to Israel via its own call centre.
The director sought an explanation and with the problem turned up at the hotel's reception.
The answer he was given, Lanzmann, in his words, tears.'
The hotel manager replied that the measure had been subpoenaed at the discretion of the management of Kempinski Hotels.
The reason for the director has become even more irritating.
Footage critic Most of our guests are Arabs and have demanded that the call code of Israel be deleted, the subpoena 'quoted Lanzmann's staff in his letter.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung ambassador to Israel in Germany, the Yakov Hadas- Handelsman case has been described as a foolhardy major disgrace.
We were horrified and shocked by the event.
In itself, it is a huge disgrace.
The fact that something like this occurred in Germany and, moreover, in such a hotel chain, is an even greater shame.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the correct conclusions, scoring.
The event triggered a strong reaction online, people have called it scandalous.
Some believe the Kempinski hotel has simply apologised has lost the riches' in the demands of Arab customers.
Explaining to Hanba to you, the scam is in another contribution, which points out that the hotel, which is located in the noble streets of Kurfurstendamm, stands near the synagogue.
According to the Spiegel newspaper, the hotel itself was quick to dismiss any charges by calling the event a sneak peek of the defender 'and Lanzman's apologising apologised'.
Footage critic has never been given a direct order of footage not to include Israel in the code for calls, quoting Suddeutsche Zeitung representative of the Kempinski hotel.
Adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber projectiles against protester Brazilian students
A conflict of students and police took place in Brazil's San Paulo on Thursday when students gathered for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police against protesters used tear gas and rubber projectiles.
The problem escalated when government-held services tried to break up the students, which ended with police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
The demonstration was attended by several hundred students in order to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals for the governor of San Paulo, Geraldo Alckmina in order to save money is also the closure of almost hundreds of public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration could be seen spraying on the walls of the inscriptions against the temporary president, Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets in support of seeded President Dilma Rousseff as the Senate ruled on her arraignment in the country.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, the Levy Dzhagaryana increased after lifting the sanctions between Moscow and Tehran's business turnover in the year ahead by 70.9 per cent.
As the ambassador said, since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies trading in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
The further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016 trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period for 2015 and reached $856 million.
Specifically, Russia's exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent and reached $697 million.
Russia's import from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
The jump increase in trade has ensured supplies of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons, the broadcaster said.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Last year, Russia's diplomatic mission in Iran issued around 35,000 visas to Iran's citizens, mostly travel.
Moreover, Iran first came among the top 20 countries, according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It can safely be said that record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia from last year will be overcome, the broadcaster said.
But at the same time, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians.
Footage critic Personally I can recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where they are in good condition dogged by the monuments of ancient Persian civilisation, Singaporeans said.
Cattle Callum Skinner rushing home after Britons got gold in cycling
Callum Skinner of Scotland entered the hall of fame last night in the men's team sprint on a velodrome in Rio when a trio of the VB team defended the title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was in the role of the brake he took for his Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy, and the youngster was delighted when he lashed out at the goal and stole victory from the hands of the favoring New Zealand.
Surprisingly, Britain won four years ago, and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And the same trick was repeated after the end of a modest sixth at the world championships in the runway cycling in March, though Hoy, meanwhile, ended his career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for specialist injury campaigner Jamie Staff.
So Hindes appeared just in time.
After leaving Hoye, there was also a vacancy that attempted to fill Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was with the Hoyas champion four years ago - and Skinnery reached the Olympic record in qualifying but the T-shirts took over in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio gained gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind on his bike, but Kenny's team pushed forward and Skinner kept the lead.
The change in strategy was a major part of the transformation, when Hindes went on a higher transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and, in part, to Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy was watching the race from his position as the BBC commentator and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes stepped onto the podium, he didn't let his eyes fall off them.
Twenty-three-year-old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said:
I'm here to get the best out of myself and do the honour of my name.
We made the Olympic record in the final and we beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After a triumph alongside Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he had fallen on the track on purpose after a weak start.
The remark was later pulled back and the rivals of Britain had no option to appeal.
This time around this victory there was no such problem.
Hindes said: Scoring spree With all those British flags in the stands I felt like I was in London.
In the last three months, we all have been together as a team.
We've lost in many of the world's races, so again winning the Olympics is just amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for the nation, which has won seven of the ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be a measure of progress over the past five months, then we have a successful five days waiting for us on the velodrome.
With the form that Kenny has demonstrated, it is not inconceivable that he would repeat Hoyt's success and win three gold medals at the same time.
That would then be for Kenny - who is exactly a day 12 years younger than Hoy, also having a birthday on 23 March -LRB- this date seems to be for British sport sacred, on this day's birthday also by Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister-RRB- - to mean a total of six gold and one silver medal.
Anyway, how much did Hoy get.
As next, Kenny will participate in the sprint starting today and it will take another three days.
The 28-year-old, from Bolton, said: Glamorous Reveals Now I enjoy this one.
The team race is always the best.
You win with the others.
To tell the truth, winning alone is a little lonely.
Hindes said: Scoring spree If he wins the next two gold medals, he should be given a knighthood.
That was the only medal race that day, but Britain was waiting for more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in the coaching race of cooperatives for four kilometres.
They finished with a time of 3: 51.943.
The world record, which fell in London in 2012, is 3: 51.659.
The first round and the final -LRB- 22: 42-RRB- are taking place in today's second day of the race, which will certainly focus Wiggins.
Yesterday before the qualifier, he was discussing with the Commissioner when the referee called him to soften the height.
In a similar race to women who continue and end tomorrow, they reached Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shando, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie world record with a time of 4: 13.260.
The VB team has relied on its strong team of wire cycling and has mastered the mid-season Olympic Games and has won plenty of medals.
After a truly exceptional performance, demonstrating total superiority in Beijing and London, it has decreased in preparation for Rio's expectations.
In the background, dramatic events unfolded, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April on charges of sexism and discrimination, and the end of a career of greats such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of the race on the velodrome, it seems the legendary reputation that the Great Britain team can deliver with the perfect timing could be reaffirmed.
The uncertain future of the tapestry in Portland after the end of the contract for energy supply
The future of the Portland aluminium melting plant in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant, which has supplied electricity, and which has informed the intention of one of the industry's owners to put an end to the electricity supply contract. It is expected that all electricity supply contracts will be cut short.
This move comes after what the state of Victoria ruled earlier this year that it would not prolong the provision of subsidies that keep the business going.
The fixed 20-year grant expires in November.
In Alcoa Portland, up to 2,000 jobs can be at risk.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk - direct or indirect.
And as the tapestry consumes around 10 percent of the total produced electricity in Victoria, there may be more lavish impacts.
Alcoa closed Tamil Point Henry in 2014, leading to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's tussle in Portland is rife and threatens to close.
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the business, initially in response to a strong Australian dollar and recently because of prices for the production of the plant.
AGL, which big melting aluminium supplies electricity from the Loy Yang A in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects one of the other three owners to also decide to quit the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, small business shares held by Chinese company CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp.
Footage critic AGL expects the Portland race to continue to work, in other words, that the spy demand for electricity from the melting pot will continue, the broadcaster said.
AGL said the contracts were the so-called giveaways of the reinsurance contract of the Feds, which were to come into force from November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month notice period, so their validity will actually end in 2017.
Singaporean AGL continues to assume contracts will take part in profit for the fiscal 2017 blackout, "the plant said.
Any potential impact on AGL's profits from fiscal 2018 onwards is currently limited due to the strong outlook for the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written the value of the contracts according to its accounting books of $187 million of giveaways in case the shutdown occurred.
Alcoa said that the contract's decision to put an end to Singaporeans has no impact on its... ability to operate a melting pot or to secure electricity supply in the melting pot.
The US company said it closed with Loy Yang's contract for 20 years in 2010, which was due to start from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has retreated from the contract.
Analysts are very careful about the possible closure of the Portland tapestry in Victoria and the Tomago plant in the vicinity of Newcastle as a result of the weak economy in the sector.
Head of operations AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who addressed analysts at the start of this week, said Portland was consuming around 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
If both of these businesses were withdrawn from the market, it would be a substantial reduction in demand for the market -LSB- electricity -RSB-.
It would not be good for us as a producer, "he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the real-estate TV show Kardashian - now it's the cover of September Vogue
Kendall Jenner-LRB- 20-RRB-, model and fourth daughter of mother-in-law of the Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the title page of the September issue of the US magazine Vogue.
Kendall, an embassy spokeswoman for Estee Lauder, who preyed on the fashion tweets in Milan, Paris and New York, the newspaper announced Thursday on her account on Instagram.
In a room full of people I love, in my view of this front page, she wants to cry, critic 'wrote Kendall.
The cover story was followed by a bizarre -LRB- or simply continuation of the humour in the Kardashians? -RRB- staged video, in which the entire family of Kardashian-Jenner-LRB- bashing riot police Rob and Caitlyn, and along with them all the popular uncle from the show business, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest -RRB-, they had forgotten the cover of their sister, only for the scene to end in a classic turn: Preparing a secret party.
It's a walled-up of the act line of almost every Singaporean birthday pageant's children's TV show - LRB- Seacrest is haunting: Sneak peek Thought we have forgotten you? Celebrities' sincerity of the cartoon rabbit in the show at eight o'clock in the morning - RRB-, but Kris somehow needed to make sure the other girls on this publicity could feed on that publicity stunt.
Because if we look at the September number of Vogue magazine, we've certainly entered the new Kardashian era.
Older sister Kim perhaps Kendall doted on the cover of Vogue -LRB- she was on it together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014 - RRB-, but the headline of the September edition of the magazine is a different league.
The September issue of Vogue magazine is the best-selling number of the year.
The issue, which makes its thickness more reminiscent of a book for advertising purposes than a fashion magazine, attracts a whole series of advertisers-LRB- Fashionist to count that of the 832 pages in last year's issue were 615 pages with advertising content -RRB-.
The revelation of the star appearing on the front page is eagerly awaited, so it is not surprising that in the past two years the pictures of the magazine have escaped before its official publication.
Among the women who have appeared in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelist or Kate Moss.
In the past few years, on the front page, there has certainly been more of a sneak peek of celebrities who are making models of poop 'rather than homemade models that are celebrities enough.'
Jennifer Lawrence, the winner of the Oscar and embassy brand Dior, appeared on the caption in 2013, a year later, she had the honour of lags Gaga.
But even if it's very unlikely that Kendall - which the magazine describes as a Singaporean breakthrough model of Singaporeans' her generation - will fall into the first category, she will be in a very good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, or stars of the realms show, or the children of today who know how to do well-cropped video-LRB- even if Jenner represents all this -RRB-.
They are demonstrably talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career thanks to the release of the Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is enthusiastic about Jenner's success.
Her position in the world of fashion will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymour, the original model of the Victoria Swimming Secret in June, criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, and she called them tearful girls of the moment of womanhood.
These feelings were reignited with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this discontent is not in place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the right sense.
He's showing off for Mark Jacobs.
He sells you makeup from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their own paywalls.
She sells pictures of daughter Cindy Crawford, who she photographed for LOVE magazine.
And in free moments, she works in a reality show, perhaps only as one of the ways to see Kourtney and her children.
Community centres of legal aid a year will be rejected by 160 000 people
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable are legal aid every year in community centers, and in the sector itself, they are preparing for the effects that will have additional funding constraints on already overstretched services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly people in advanced age, immigrants, threat workers, victims of violence and people without funding to fight unfair evictions and the like - are denied by the time they seek free legal help and representation.
Community legal services that are already so tense to rupture are poised to make further cuts.
From June next year, the legal aid centres will lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The director of community centres of legal aid in Queensland, James Farrell, said that, according to the latest summary report, the National Association of Communities Legal Aid Centre was found to have rejected five thousand people each year.
Mr Farrell said that without cancelling the federal government's decision, the situation would get worse.
Singaporean communities of legal aid in Queensland are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are being rejected by the vital services they need, Singaporeans said.
People who have escaped from relationships with the rapist, people with excessive and crippling debts, families passing by separation, workers who are unfairly released - all these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows they have no chance of getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which will lead to more thousands of endangered people from Queensland having to navigate in complex legal problems without help.
We call on the prosecutor and senator Queensland's George Brandis to immediately prevent this shortening of the finances so that people get the help they need when they get into legal problems.
In the past year, the state government has dogged its commitment to secure funding for legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community centres of legal aid and the community of their clients and the Palaszczuk Government must invest in this important work.
A lawsuit on Donald Trump's campaign after a member of staff allegedly levelled the gun
New York: On Donald Trump's campaign, a lawsuit was filed for alleged inaction after being told that the director of operations at North Carolina in February aimed the gun at a member of staff during the ride of the Jeep.
The incident was described in a court file on Wednesday at the state court in Charlotte passed by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer of the campaign in the state.
Bordini said he had been waiting months for the situation to be resolved internally before he concluded that the scoring spree would not become a giveaway.
Director Earl Phillip twirled the fingers of the gun, put the right index finger on the trigger and levelled the barrel of Vincent on the kneecap of the squid, Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The file says that, after a complaint from local and regional leadership, he found that at least four other people had seen the same thing with Phillip.
Stripping the gates does not need to be fired to cause damage to the defender, "Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican candidate for the president caused an upheaval when voters in North Carolina said they could step up owners and gun-holders - LRB- which is set in the US in the Second Amendment of the Constitution - RRB- if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and will be able to appoint his judges.
Trump's campaign says the media has taken his words out of context and that Trump has not defended the violence.
In the lawsuit, Bordini requests compensation from the campaign for lax supervision and from Phillip to a threat to personal safety, the illegal use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the request for comment.
Attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news outlet in the city of Charlotte, reported that Phillip had left the campaign recently.
A call to his consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services did not respond during the short period.
The Republican candidate for President Donald Trump is leading the controversial election campaign.

Britain must spread further Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not just for our local communities and across London but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is a huge way of appealing, just as it was London 2012, when we have made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions can benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games were huge benefits for Startford and East End.
And we will do it again by creating opportunities for local people and companies in the vicinity of Heathrow.
Just for our local communities, we will create 10,000 new teaching places, 40,000 new jobs, and end up with the unemployment of young people around the airport.
Just like before the London Olympics in 2012, there are those who will think that the expansion of Heathrow is too big.
I have been told that Britain will never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we will be ridiculed on the world stage.
Doubters were wrong in 2012, and even in the case of Heathrow, it turns out they were wrong.
There will always be obstacles, but Heathrow can answer every question that concerns it.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is a infrastructure project on which many people and companies are involved, not just a few.
The extension is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of £211 billion, to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has introduced a programme of investment in infrastructure for £11 billion, starting with the T5 terminal - which was voted the best terminal in the world for five years, after the T2 terminal, which was built between two of the busiest rankings in the world.
They are now ready to deliver the third runway, worth £16 billion of private investment.
The Games in London in 2012 were the huge success of the UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be it.
It is time for us to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and extend Heathrow, secure business for the future, and leave the legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Board of Directors and an earlier Deputy Commissioner for Business Affairs.
AdBlock Plus - Facebook in game to cat and mouse in blocking ads
Attempts to bypass the advertising-blocking programs have become a cat-and-mouse game for the companies that make online marketing, at least one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block advertising filters on its desktop website, Adblock Plus posted a contribution on its website, stating that users can update filters in their program and re-block advertising on this social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website would change coding around ads to make it more difficult for advertising filters to find out which parts of the page are advertising.
But AdBlock now says the new codes have already been passed.
In a blog post, Adblock Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that Singaporeans this kind of war between the community's open source blocking ads and those who are trying to get around them, it takes since blocking ads invented, texting, and that Facebook is likely to come up with another own fix.
The fact that the company owning the world's largest social network has been involved in the war just proves the big problem with blocking ads for the industry.
According to the study, the tweed last year performed Pagefair and Adobe used worldwide filters advertising around 200 million people - nearly four times that of it in 2013.
Mobile advertising is now reaching 84 per cent of the profits from advertising on Facebook, every day Facebook from mobile devices visit 1.03 billion active users.
The spokesman said the company goes against advertising stillbirths on desktops, as mobile filters advertising for mobile apps for the social network and Instagram do not work.
Ads on desktops still represent a profit so high that Facebook will decide to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday that it will update the tool for Singaporean settings for advertising the left' -LRB- ad-RRB-, to give people the ability to better control how the ads are shown to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said AdBlock's new filters were concerned because it could also block content that has nothing to do with advertising.
Texting celebrities For people it's not a pleasant experience, and we want to solve this problem, texting a Facebook spokesperson in an emailed statement.
Blocking advertising is an insensitive tool, and we have instead focused on building tools such as Ad Preferences that give control to people.
Woman was hit by car's Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to the event, which on Thursday in the early hours was on the highway of several cars by a woman who was likely to have tried to commit suicide.
The accident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight in the quarter.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the actor apologised to the desperate crime scene 'lying in the dark on the road and overran her several cars.
It is understood the victim, a woman aged 49, wanted to be killed and hit by several cars, including a lorry.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers have already been interviewed, but police still have not yet been identified. Police are calling on these drivers and all the others who witnessed the incident to come forward.
A criminal investigation has been opened, texting a logical critic 'step in a situation like this, he said to Le Tribune de Geneve legal counsel Gilles Hofstetter.
It remains to be seen whether any of the concerned drivers will face any charges.
Could the impact be prevented?
That's what the prosecutor has to find out, hooker said Hofstetter.
On the basis of two such cases over the past five years, it appears that drivers will not be responsible.
In both cases - of which one was a person walking along the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was cleared of manslaughter charges after being knocked down and killed by a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne in August 2014.
In court, it was heard that the victim, aged 22, had been drinking alcohol and had fainted on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - drove in a reasonable manner and that the presence of a man on the road was a foolhardy of an entirely exceptional and unpredictable situation, the subpoena 'said the judge.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident, which occurred at Morges, should apply to police on telephone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agents and Agencies - LRB- AČCKA-RRB- expects to fetch up to 20,000 visitors within the Prague Pride of Prague.
On Friday, it was told by executive director AČCKA Catherine Petříčková.
The sixth year of the Prague Pride began on 8 August, the festival approaches life leaps, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals -LRB- LGBT-RRB-.
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
Singaporeans Prague are among the most popular destinations in the LGBT community, for a high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialist businesses, Singaporeans said.
According to a survey of organisers, foreign visitors are spending £3100 per person on average per day.
Gay tourists are in support of their travel to make special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile apps etc.
Reward photography For tourism in general, LGBT clients are very lucrative, interested in stays in higher pricing sessions with a high standard of travel services and spending more than others, the broadcaster has told Petříckova.
There is also the first Pride Tourism Symposium in the festival this year.
He is being lectured to by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the US and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main issue this year is love, but action will also be devoted to several thematic areas that are family, prevention of AIDS and transgender issues.
The summit of the festival will be a traditional procession with allegorical cars on Saturday, which will go from Wenceslas Square to the Air Force.
The procession, which has been taken by thousands of people in recent years, will honour a minute's silence in memory of the victims of a June attack at a nightclub in Orlando, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat are celebrating forty years.
The undeterred cutbacks Pat and Mat, whose efforts end up usually a disaster, have enjoyed small and large spectators for forty years.
The pilot episode of this evening's series director, The Golden Bench, premiered on August 12, 1976.
For the emergence of this animated series, now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries in the world, the cartoons of the artist and director of the Art of Benevolent, which he made up for the magazine with two bullets, were the masters of Ouholt and Sedle.
Beneš then added to the co-operation of the Dramatis of George Kumar and the artist Vladimir Jiránek, and together they made the film of the Kuties.
Today's form with yellow and red shirts and balls and radios were given the figures in 1979, when it began in the Short Film of Prague to create the series for Slovak television.
The names of Pat and Mat then the crossbenchers were given in 1985, this time it was already right for the Short Film Prague.
In 1990, Beneš established his own studio animated film of AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other parts were created.
After his death in 1995, more parts were continuing with other creators, many of whom were helped by Benes's son Mark.
There is currently over ninety episodes with the stories of these cutias, who are all sizzling under their hands, but never angry at each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and Kutillian enthusiasm, and finally they are satisfied with their work, which will demonstrate a familiar gesture of homemade giveaways... and it is! Vindication.
Pat and Mat have even moved from the TV screens to books, on DVD and theatre, and characters or other toys with the depiction of Pat and Mata are a hitter of every toy store.
A fairytale for Fiji and for the two-year-old Harmony.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we have chosen one sporting and one of life for you.
Both have a good ending.
So let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the reason for the whole country's joy?
The two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
And for what kind of things people spend the most on airports?
That's a Friday summary from the world's Web sites.
First medal of the Olympic Games.
Historic success slams the island nation of Fiji.
Rugby league's selection of this archipelago has defeated the Olympic tournament's seventh-seeded rugby team.
It is the first medal that Fiji has gained for itself in the Olympics.
The wait for a first-security gain lasted sixty years from posting the first expedition to the Olympic Games.
A big credit to the success is borne by the coach of Fiji.
But it is ironic that he is Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading the way since 2013 and after the finals as a British citizen, he could be happy to make the difference from his countrymen.
Sneak peek Let's play freely and easily and we'll see if the biggest game in our history can be done, scoring 'said the coach before the final.
Fiji eventually dominated it, and a small state with 900 thousands of inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic story.
The report was brought by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and lucky for a little girl.
2-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living with no hands and feet for 11 months, has been given a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
Glamorous Reveals Mom, she's like me, apologised to a two-year-old girl, as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take the doll off her hands and feet and then sit together without a prosthetic leg.
Harmony was diagnosed with meningitis Type B in the entire year of life, doctors gave her only a 10 per cent chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny, and she never gives up.
He also has an insight.
I saw her represent the other children with the words Hi, I'm Harmonie, and I don't have my hands, my mother added.
Look at the joy the doll has made.
What are we spending the most on at the airport?
CNN provides a finding that people at airports spend most on bottled water.
A chain of sales of Hudson Auctions travel essential stores published data for the last year, where it summarises 10 products that customers buy in its stores at airports most often.
The water was a sovereign first.
The drinks were generally very popular, ranked eight in the first ten.
The ninth place took a large pack of M & M's with coconut flavours.
And can you guess who's closing the first ten?
As one of the above things, you can't eat.
According to CNN, this is the Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Spaceship sovereigns.
We're just going to win, laughing Murray with Bond.
The rowers of Eric Murray and Hamish Bond of New Zealand have been captivating the category of courtship with no helmsman for seven years, and their dominance has been confirmed at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games.
At first glance, the disparate couple went to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and have been crushing the competition since 2009.
On the lagoon Rodriga de Freitase, in the quarter-final, they credited the 69th win in a row.
What are we different from?
We're just nicer, joking Murray already during the Olympic regress when he was to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand couple.
Frankly, we don't do anything different from others.
We just train hard, very hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their dominance is remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is almost a two-foot-and-a-foot chaser, the academically-looking Bond is five inches smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
Moreover, they also have a different nature.
Bond is studying and dedicated to finance, Murray has for example a charity boxing match.
Even for that, he doesn't spend much time apart from rowing.
Eric's getting into the ship basically that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what can go wrong, Bond admitted, which, even at the press conference, demonstrated that Murray was dominant in the crew.
He had always answered first and Bond was waiting for his opportunity.
On the water, however, it destroys an opponent with a calm force.
They're going at their pace, and while they're still not in the middle of the line, opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We're racing on a two-mile track and we never wanted to go the first kilometre of the pitch.
We're just trying to ride the pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said the 24-year-old Murray.
With his four years younger partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the golden four without a helmsman.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to switch to two without a helmsman.
In London, the London Olympics may have been the biggest defeat of their careers, and the dominance was confirmed in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask for anything.
This time it was a bit more fun.
We knew it was going to be bloody hard, and we had to make sure we were on that mentally well, Murray said.
We know everyone wants to overthrow us from the throne.
We still have that target on our back.
But we are trying to be half a step in front of everyone, he added.
Model of climate by NASA: Venus was once habitable
According to the design of the new NASA climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute of NASA for the study of the universe have developed a model for exploring Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by scientists engaged in studying climate.
The model was designed to determine whether it was once on Venus, whose surface is hot, without water and saturated CO2, could reign conditions similar to Earth's conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low rate of Venus rotation can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But, according to the most recent simulations, Venus may have once been proud of the thin atmosphere of Earth, turning slowly.
The model also addressed the earlier topography of Venus.
On the planet, there were probably areas drier than Earth, but there was plenty of water and latitude for it to rule life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus previously also used the Sun, which was 30 per cent more muted.
Footage premiere In a simulation of the GISS Venus model during a slow rotation, he exposes his day side to the sun almost two months at a time, scoring a scientist from GISS Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This is where heating the surface and making the rain, which produces a dense layer of clouds that act as an umbrella and the surface grips in front of too much solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model has set up the story of Venus similar to an evolution that previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Even though Venus has probably been habitable in the past -- over several billion years -- it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated, and water vapor was the ultraviolet light burned.
Hydrogen has escaped and there's only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of greenhouse gas -- that's Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers published their results from the new climate model of Venus published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned to post coach of Colorado Avalanche team
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday to his post as coach and vice president of hockey operations team the Colorado Avalanche, as the reason put the impossibility of taking part in the decision-making process on the team's issues.
Executive vice president comedian @ general manager of Colorado Joe Sakic has confirmed the move and said the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
Explaining the Final for the last three years, I served as the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination, scoring a 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
For a long time and intensively over the years, I've been thinking about how I can improve the team, give him the depth he needs, and get it to a higher level.
To achieve this, it is imperative that the vision of a coach and vice president of hockey operations be in line with the vision of the organisation.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who took Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his team's benefits.
Freshman Lt. Patrick told me about his decision today, Lt. 'Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the best coach in the league during his first season with the Avalanche 2013 giveaway @ 2014.
He led the team to a gain of 112 points and a first place in the Central Division.
The Avalanche team in season 2015 scoring @ 2016 reached a score of 39: 39-4 and was missing five points to get a second wild card in the Western Conference.
Goalkeeper Roy, who enrolled in the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Workers on an oil rig in the North Sea resume talks and interrupt the strike
Senior party officials said the strikes due to wages for oil rig workers in the North Sea are being interrupted, while all parties to the dispute have gathered for a new round of negotiations.
To strike against the company's services for oil fields Wood Group sporadically took place on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
Singaporeans Wood Group and trade union organisations Unite and RMT can confirm that they have agreed to renew the process to tackle current disagreements, the subpoena says in a statement.
Starting next week, we will have a series of all-day meetings over the coming few weeks, where we will try to see the problems from new angles.
According to unions, their recent actions, which have been the first in more than 25 years, have been in protest against wage cuts of up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group has cut rates this year and paid its suppliers in the North Sea about 9 per cent less due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate cut comes after a 10 per cent cut for coastal companies in 2014.
The company says that further cuts would provide the company with a market downturn.
On the other hand, Shell has removed thousands of people from its payrolls and announced plans to abandon operations on oil and gas fields to in 10 countries for the modernisation of its processes - immediately after a mega merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low oil prices, the economic situation associated with the UK's decision to leave the European Union.
A member of parliament from Scotland, Dave Anderson, met with union leaders at the start of this week to discuss one of the biggest working disagreements of a whole generation that led to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, as he said, is vital to the region's economy.
Pioneering in the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for all, not just for some, Singaporeans said in a statement.
For comparison, nearly $1.4 billion of investment in new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, while the average for the past five years was around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleiades
The latest Kepler Space Telescope mission to help astronomers is to get an almost complete list at the rate of rotation of stars from the Pleiades cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster revolve at different speeds, and also how the rotation period is linked to the formation of the planet.
Sincerely, we hope to compare our results with other starlets to learn more about the relationship between the star mass, its stable and even history in its solar system, the critic said in a new report by Louise Rebullo, a research worker in the center of the Caltech Swimming Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
A cluster of Pleiades is 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now just reaching the state of adulthood and have arisen about over 125 million years.
Now it is turning fast.
At moments of maximum rotation, these teenage stars release huge amounts of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
Along with the way the star is aging, her speed of rotation also slows.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by measuring the time between discovering the discernible points on the stars -- similar sunspots.
According to the latest data on the speeds of rotation, larger stars are rotating more slowly than the less massive stars.
Rebullo likens the stars to the dancers, bigger making pirouettes more slowly than the smaller ones.
Scoring a dunk in a Singaporean ballet of Singaporeans we see that slower-spinning stars are more massive, while those that revolve the fastest are usually very light stars, chaps said, Rebullo said.
Because it is so close to the Cluster, it serves as the ideal space laboratory for matching the quality of the stars and the speed of rotation.
Warmer Pleiades provide us anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, in both younger and older stars, Singaporean said.
There's still a lot we want to know about how, when and why the stars are slowing down their speed of rotation, and so belatedly they'll hang their dance shoes on a nail polish.
Rebullo and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis at the rate of rotation of the Birds in three studies, which will soon be published in the journal Astronomical Journal.
Is the qualifying deal necessary?
If I didn't subscribe, then the qualifying deal would not be closed and, after a few months, could I go to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work without logging into special education?
I am concerned that in the field in which I would like to work, there is now a vacancy just in a slightly more remote hospital, but about half a year could relax a place in another where I would then like to work.
So I don't know how to deal with the situation roughly that half-year, the inquiry continues.
Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
No legislation provides for the obligation to conclude a qualifying agreement with the employer - the hospital.
The Qualification Agreement is a legal institute governed by the law of work, and may be concluded between an employee and an employer in order to ensure a return on costs incurred by increasing or increasing the worker's qualifications.
In the area of health, there is long-term pressure on the unlocking of these agreements to ensure the working mobility of healthcare workers, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Law No 95 Genocide, @ 2004 Sb., on the conditions of obtaining and recognition of proficiency and specialist fitness to perform the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, is explicitly stating that participation in the specialisation training is considered as a deepening of the classification of - LRB- rather than its increase - RRB-.
This means that a qualifying agreement can be concluded under the Labour Code only if the costs amount to at least £75,000.
There is no provision in the legislation or the obligation to enter into special education.
The law only lays down the conditions for the application for inclusion in the field of specified training.
However, the doctor may, under the law, be authorised to exercise a doctor's profession by completing the required university studies, although under the legal conditions of -LRB- under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialised competence in the relevant field of -RRB-.
The law foresees a situation where the training of a doctor may be included in the professional experience performed in another field of specialisation if its content and scope correspond to the relevant education programme.
In theory, it would be possible to count the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the melting point of the situation.
However, in the light of the fact that I do not know the circumstances of this case, a consultation with the relevant Department of Health - LRB- the Department of Science and medical profession - RRB- is recommended, since the Department of Health provides an advisory and consultation service related to the inclusion in the specialisation training and its passage.
The advisory service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Association, whose member must be a member.
Doctors from Syrian Halabu are asking for US intervention.
The United States has not made any effort to end the siege of -LRB- rebel-held parts of the city by government troops-RRB-, and did not use its influence to promote the protection of civilians, cited from a letter addressed to the White House by the AFP.
Verdict Reveals We do not need tears, compassion, and even prayers; however, we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over the eastern Halamb to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab will not be re-encircled, the paramedics said.
Russia's forces, backed by the army loyal to President Bashar Assad, have announced that they will stop every day for three hours of strikes in the Halabu region to allow safe passage of the humanitarian convoys.
From 9: 00 to 12: 00 P.M., all military activities, air attacks and artillery fire are to be stopped.
The head of UN humanitarian operations, Stephen Oscars, welcomed this, however, stressing that there was a need for at least a two-day ceasefire.
On Obama, according to AFP, in the letter, 15 of the 35 doctors who operate in the eastern part of Halabu are already controlled by the rebels.
They say that during the five-year war they witnessed the violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world watches and notes how complex Syria is, but does little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation of residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sounds like only slightly veiled threats, said pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors.
Doctors said there had been 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria over the past month, from 15 to hospitals in which they work.
The most sad thing is that we have to decide who lives and who dies.
We have small children coming to the ER with such serious injuries that we must choose between them who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the necessary material to help them, described by doctors.
Two weeks ago, they suffocated four newborns when the blast broke the supply of oxygen to their incubators.
They were gasping for breath, and then their life was over - before he could really begin, he recalled.
The army loyal to President Bashar Assad, backed by Russian forces, has surrounded the rebel-controlled eastern part of Halabu in recent weeks, inside with no food supply of over 200,000 people.
The rebels, who are under constant strikes by the Russian and Syrian Air Force, managed to break the siege on Saturday after three weeks, and to launch a counter-offensive.
Both sides then added reinforcements in the city and its neighborhood.
