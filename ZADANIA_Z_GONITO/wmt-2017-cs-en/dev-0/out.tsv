Republican Party's strategy against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders have justified their policy of combating electoral fraud.
But the Brennan Center describes such a fraud as a myth that electoral fraud is less common in the US than the number of people who die after being struck by lightning.
Indeed, Republican attorneys have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US over the past decade.
One thing is certain: These new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures, in part, undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, the US is responsible for the organization of the federal election.
And, in this vein, most US governments have denounced the new laws that make the choice or enrollment process more difficult.
The phenomenon marked a boom after the November 2010 election, during which there were 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 amendments to the law restricting electoral law in 41 states were submitted only in 2011.
New electoral laws require voters to present an identity card with a photograph and a proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the period for elections in advance, invalidating the right to sign up to a list of voters on the day of the election, and they have an electoral right to citizens with a criminal record.
Before the 2006 election, he did not require any American state to be presented with a photograph of a photograph.
The first state to implement this requirement was Indiana.
The constitutionality of the Indiana law was confirmed by the US Supreme Court in 2008.
Republican authorities rushed to extend the process to other states.
Over the past two years, it has supported proposals for such laws in 34 states to force voters to submit ID cards with photos.
It should be noted that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as the health insurance card.
In fact, it does not own 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people in an age allowed to vote, no photo ID with a photograph issued by the government office of their state.
He also does not have that identity card of about five million new voters in 2012.
Moreover, the acquisition of the required identity card often costs more than $100.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affecting mainly young, minority and low-income people.
25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with income under 35,000; 18% of those aged over 65, and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters by their bow to Democratic candidates are not allowed to use their identity card in several states with a photo posted by their school.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who elect Republican candidates, cards drawn up by these clubs at the election.
Until 2004, there was no proof of citizenship in the elections.
The first such request was introduced by Arizona.
Since 2011, about a dozen states have adopted laws that impose an obligation on voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two of the three Hispanics prefer a democratic party.
Republican lawmakers in 2011 supported in eight states laws that disturb enrollment of voters on the day of the election.
They have also restricted the right of people and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to sign up.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the general election in 2004, campaigns for enrollment voters to register around 10 million people.
However, the measures taken after 2009 caused a decrease in the writing of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers, in another five states, adopted laws aimed at shortening the period for elections in advance.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, African-Americans were 33% of voters who voted in advance, although African-American voters in the state were only 13%.
In Hispanics, it was the same.
They accounted for just 11% of all voters, but 24% of citizens vote in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who accounted for 76% of all voters, accounted for only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have been very strongly opposed to the approval of the laws that restrict voter registration.
Democratic governors have blocked several bills of law by their veto.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, the attorney general of the United States has even been struck.
The damage was done in part.
For example, laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with a photograph have taken only 16 of 34 states.
But the newly introduced rules make it quite indisputably difficult in 2012 to exercise the right to vote.
Democratic critics talk primarily about the preconceptions of approved laws, and see them as an apparent effort to influence the results of elections in 2012 in key states.
The report by the Brennan Centre of 2011 shows that states where these laws were approved represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral college necessary to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain today: These new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures, in part, undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: Do you have an examination or not?
The PSA test brought sometimes flawed results that were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, resulting in unnecessary medical interventions.
All of this has increased the lure of men who have been so reluctant to investigate at all.
Getting examined or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the US, there has been a high level of contamination between the individual test groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and make recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a different mortality rate among patients who underwent examinations, and those who did not go to them.
This study also demonstrated after a 12-year separation that those who do not follow-up have a 30-40% higher risk of metastasis.
So I recommend testing from 50 years of age or from 40 years, if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also a more vulnerable group.
The key is to take the right decision once the cancer is revealed.
There are aggressive kinds of cancer and such species that are listless.
So it is necessary to properly explain to the patient the dangers of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not to treat prostate cancer, which does not have an impact on life in the long term, and focus on active oversight of the disease in the long run.
Today, many of the men who have been diagnosed are not treated, as their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten them in life.
Instead, we will propose to them to carry out active supervision, and in the event of disease progression, we will offer them treatment.
Increasingly, and with greater precision, we identify criteria that help in deciding which type to treat and which do not.
Still, I recommend you take the exam.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and to determine whether it is appropriate to undergo or not.
In collaboration with the International Urological Society, it has created the Movember movement that allows it to be evaluated for and against the PSA.

Disease prevention
Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure for preventing cancer.
Despite the advances in research, it seems the best means for limiting the risks of disease adopting the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if all of them ate and moved enough, it could prevent up to 30% of cancer cases.
Fewer celebrities If they all quit smoking, that figure would rise to at least 50%, starring Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Research Society.
By contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer is caused by inheritance.
Some percentage also remains completely unexplained.
For Canada's cancer research company, tackling smoking remains a priority, even though the number of smokers is falling.
Cigarettes are worth 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
Farther out today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec, scoring head spokesman Andre Beaulieu.
Encouraging figure: 10 years after a smoker stops smoking, the risk of dying for cancer is halved.
Weight
Incarceration and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus.
Footage Photograph From the research shows that regular bodily activity throughout life protects against colon cancer, texting 'delivers the report.
Nutrition
That organisation also recommends limiting red meat consumption.
Too much consumption can lead to increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is appropriate to avoid sausages for which the same applies.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to carcinogenicity.
Prostate gland Can cause damage to the cells of the organism and lead to the development of cancer, texting 'delivers the report.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
But research has not yet produced clear conclusions.
Studies focused on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
Although, according to one of them, there will be a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another study speaks more about its increase.
Neither the effect of vitamin D on cancer is clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu continues to insist on how important he is to talk about his concerns and precedents from the family with his doctor.
Prostate gland to undergo examination doesn't mean you'll have cancer.
Higgs boson explored
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a legitimate stir last summer.
There is a view that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And it is the latest particle, whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or favouritism of the least bad scoring 'explanation of the nature and behaviour of the matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
Among the physicists, however, there is still no 100 per cent certainty that it is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle that is very similar to the Higgs boson, as is predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the great physics congress in Kyoto is more likely to confirm it, but it is missing all the data so that we can have absolute certainty.
But suppose it is the Higgs boson, because the risks of error appear small, and look at what it is.
In this world, there is a completely undisputed law that two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be bypassed - and don't try too hard, or you will hurt yourself.
Even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that even the same law applies to it: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same moment, if they are in the same ludicrous quantum state of venom '- this ludicrous state of venom' roughly speaking creates some of their properties.
Then separate the physics particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find orderly citizens, or pheromones, that are dutifully adrift of the Pauli principle.
And at the other end, they move barefoot, underperforming anarchists who don't appreciate anything at all - certainly not that principle, which means they may well be in the same place at the same time.
These bogeys are further divided into two groups according to the device - LRB- by the way, the absolutely amazing -RRB, which is The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley laboratories: The mesons that we leave here unnoticed, and the homemade force particles of venom, which are spread by large natural forces, and with which the Higgs boson is likely to be related in some way.
However, it has to be said that these bogeys are not as exotic animals as it might be thought to be.
If you read this article, it's because of a boson with an unusual banality: The photon, or the homemade particle of the beam of the squid, which is homemade by the wearer of the giveaway 'electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes its course, Singaporeans disrupt the scoring of an electromagnetic field in this particular spot, similar to a pebble thrown in a pond.
From this Singaporean intrusion of the squid, there will be an electromagnetic wave -LRB- light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc. -RRB- and this wave is nothing more than a photo- and thus one of the bosons, Singaporeans of the forces of womanhood.
More stable field
Also, it's with the Higgs boson, just with the difference, that scoring spree to interrupt the scoring 'has to be another field, the Higgs field, for this boson to emerge.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; it has to be achieved by very high energy values, much like the frozen surface of a pond, that only a very large boulder will face.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator of part as a catalyst in the CERN laboratory - a large Hadron Accelerator with responsive volumes is a circle with a diameter of 27 km! - so that this energy can be developed.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field strikes us again to explain the relationship between Higgs and the matter.
With the electromagnetic field, neither the particles nor all the materials are responding.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never be left alone on the fridge.
And anyway, with the Higgs field, they don't react to all the particles: Those that do so have some substance, while others -LRB- such as photon, look at it - RRB- they don't have it.
And Mrs Newman asks what all these researches are, what Singaporeans will bring to us?
In terms of science, it is a confirmation of the validity of the Standard Model -LRB- SM-RRB-, which enables the physicists to examine any discrepancy between observations and predictions of SM.
In addition, few physicists literally want to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open up the scope of the glamorous new physics of photography and to close some of the gaps in the model.
It needs to be noted that the model has huge flaws so far, it does not provide any clarification of the gravity of -LRB- ouh! -RRB- or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the space mass -LRB- back ouh! -RRB-.
But the CERN has not disclosed such contradictions until now.
Responses
The responses of these research into Mr and Mrs Newman's everyday life can be predictably difficult, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be none.
Behold: In the early 1960s, the pioneers in Bell's labs had no idea about the revolution that their work would cause.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
The physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and which created the first permanent laser beam -LRB- previous rays were pulsing -RRB- in 1962, I have already said - the laser was initially thought to be such a homemade toy to the lab of venom.
Just imagine...
And in addition, the exercise may result from any tools surrounding the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on the optics.
This sensor, though Boyle initially didn't plan it at all, now serves as a Singaporean eye flick 'all digital cameras in the world and made him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, that doesn't mean that activities around the LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it means that you really never know...
Palliative care - The best way to leave life... | Le devoir
Through its Commission for dignified dying, Quebek recently engaged in delicate questions about the end of life.
The debate should soon continue, while a bill is forthcoming.
There is still much work to be done in this crucial area.
The magazine Le devoir attempted to look at the issue in more detail.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. was still living alone in his flat in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer eating it gave him a two-year reprieve.
Footage critic gave me five years of life and it's already seven, tearfully 'says no emotion on his bed in the house for the palliative care of Victor- Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this, texting 'adds.
The illness has done its work: An immense weakness prevents him from taking himself to the toilet or just eating himself.
He looks at a tasty-looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He is courageous and even smiles, speaking to strangers who stop at him, bringing him medication, offering a bath.
Courage for a simple death.
Footage critic Mé's biggest wish is to get rid of that diarrhea, it humiliates me, texting 'confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
Throughout life, a man learns that men urinate standing up, the comedian 'tells Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor- Gadbois facility.
Going back to the baby stage is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
Surgeon Threatens "on the abilities of that man's opponent" whether he will accept the return, a psychologist says.
In the view of a number of people engaged in palliative care, crucial moments are taking place at the heart of such a return.
Patients who enter the home with palliative care of Victor- Gadbois are all suffering from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses caring for them does not provide a so-called Singaporean rehab rehab.
In the case of Ms A., 89, she is the worst feared to die of Singaporean sufferers in full awareness of the prank '.
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
I've got good kids, chaps' adds.
Footage premiere In my life, I don't have any requests, interns say, and then convenes to put her breathing apparatus on.
Still, he is still looking forward to the following days for the last visit by a son from Italy.
In the home of the Victor- Gadbois, in collaboration with a group of volunteers, they provide care for the body with the help of nutrition.
That is how palliative care comes when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Québeku, one bed of palliative care for 11,700 residents.
That's very little if we realize we're all going to die.
Here life continues under optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Whether it's a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a man is dying, he can be given a sip of brandy or peps, depending on the taste.
Diabetics don't need to keep their blood sugar.
And death is part of everyday life.
They were carrying a beer to Mr X last night, who died later that night.
This morning, he drinks his son's beer in honor of the late father.
Sincerely apologist to patients as much as their close, defender 'tells Nathalie Savard, the director of care services.
In the home of the Victor- Gadbois go days one after another, but they don't resemble each other.
In addition to a three-year-old man who rejoiced at the last meeting with his family thoroughly laid out on cushions while pinned to his honour, he dies a tragically 36-year-old man surrounded by his parents, a woman and two young children after he tried all options to survive.
Footage Photograph For half a year, there are always three to five beds that are designed for people with cancer within 45 years, the kangaroo tells the concerns of Dr Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who come to the home of Victor- Gadbois arrive here from their homes, 47% then from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
They say that 77% of Canadians simply don't have access to palliative care, i.e., a care designed to alleviate suffering when the sick reaches the final stage of their lives, whether it be at home, in a hospital or a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of the Victor- Gadbois and the Society for the home palliative treatment of the Grand Montréal region, specialize in more or less exclusively on care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this essential unavailability of health care in Quebec that a number of doctors specialising in palliative care fears the adoption of the euthanasia law and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which they illustrate their opposition to such an initiative, has been in circulation.
According to Dr Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not powerful enough to ensure access to all people to high-quality palliative care before it can be agreed to implement euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days on high alert in huge pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to make her feel better.
It is feared that patients are not asked to be killed on the grounds that they are not receiving appropriate care.
And, at the same time, many oncologists are caring for their patients until the last few moments, regardless of the adverse prognosis.
Hopes for the survival of Hélène Richard were already entirely minimal when she left demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I quit the treatment, she replied that she regretted having stopped fighting, she tells us.
And yet she told me it was over!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr Martel estimates that 90% of the sufferers who wish to die, thanking their treating doctors for failing to fill their wishes when a team of palliative fodder has eased their pain.
But it has to be said that palliative care is certainly not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society for the Domestic Conservation Care of the Grand Montréal, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use a palliative sedative that will put the patient asleep until the end of the day, whether they crash or may be sedated.
It is impossible to pretend that we do not see this part of the suffering.
The patient we are not suffering from the pain will still have a greater opportunity to access the palliative sedatives.
The people who are not given a sedative are always saying the same thing:
But that doesn't necessarily mean foolhardy I want you to give me a euthanasia spree ', it's more of a giveaway I want you to get me out of the pain.'
The implementation of this story has allowed a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Large-scale property scandals in Quebec
Administration officials, businessmen in the construction and public works, lobbyists of political parties, and experts in the Italian mafia are still telling what they know about the amazing giveaways of the scam, in which construction, civil servants, politicians, union leaders, and mobsters mingle.
This favouritism of Singaporeans has come Quebec taxpayers dearly in particular between 1990 and 2000.
Footage VERDICT It's interesting how the system has crumbled since we took the essential measure, the comedian 'says ironically Jacques Duchesneau, the Quebec MEP and former head of police in Montreal.
In 2011, the scandal broke on the basis of a consistent investigation into the embezzlement of funds in relation to the construction of roads in Quebec, which was approved by the liberal Quebec prime minister, Jean Charest, after long delays.
Broadcaster Duchesneau's report has confirmed a direct link between industry, opaque funding of the parties and corruption of state officials.
Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, the Singaporeans have saved only the Department of Transportation on a $1 billion contract, scoring when some people have kept their instincts in check to get a stake in them!
Charbonneau's board of Singaporeans has already led to the dementia of two mayors, scoring 'delivers with the hope that it will be able to cater to the deceit of some people's left.'
A permanent unit to fight corruption established in 2011
A permanent unit to fight corruption based in 2011 is also involved in fighting with its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
To do that, police Capt. Marteau's entourage of Singaporeans, who since 2009 have ensured that the Montreal's homemade cartel of money-making giveaways has significantly lessened the infancy of the contracts...
In recent weeks, they have conducted a series of searches and indicted on fraud and corruption a number of municipal incumbents, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a community from the suburbs.
Another on the list is to be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his job as mayor of Laval, the third-largest Quebec city.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
The formal allegations have already been received by transport engineers from Montreal and businessmen of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation by the committee explaining the mechanism of remediation of the remediation system's fundraising.
He himself gave in these years 3% of the value of the contracts he acquired in Montréal, an intermediary with the mafia, who then transferred the money to Union Montréal, for whom Mayor Gerard Tremblay ran.
Zambito was generous to all parties after 2000, and gave more than 88 000 Canadian dollars -LRB- about 68,000 euros -RRB to provincial parties, especially the Liberals, who were in power then.
He also confessed to organising illegal fundraising for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money supply, whose prices have been overstated
In Montreal, the extortionate system of extortionate 'corruption was very chic.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described it in detail before the commission: Within ten years, he had received gifts from construction companies, an invitation to trips, golf tournaments, to restaurants, hockey games, and an allowance worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for contracts with the money, at which he overstated the price.
Other public officials from the transport sector admitted that they had been paid compensation for the fact that, by 30% to 40%, they overestimated invoices through false works.
The organiser of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, then accused Tremblaye of baring his eyes over the parallel budget that put dirty money in his coffers.
On the basis of these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, throwing Montréal into a massive crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to set out a warning signal.
As mayor of the perimeter of the Rivière-des- Prairies in the east of the island, he has been campaigning against the sale of a municipal property purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promotions right in the middle of a booming real estate deal.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be launched, says the Singaporeans are pulling the strings in an attempt to understand the workings of the soaked ants system to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits.
The process, according to her, is exquisitely painful but positive enough.'
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but it has to be set up in Montréal's own investigative unit and ensure that these questionable practices cannot be undone.
Like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says the Singaporeans public officials have alienated hundreds of millions of dollars of giveaways, but he fears, in particular, the role of Singaporean MPs informed of this lrish prank 'if they haven't been mobbed in these chests!
He estimates that 70% of the funding of the election campaign in Québeku comes from dirty money, and, with irony, adds: Left.'
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $100, but that's not going to solve the situation: Singaporeans Until it is strictly limited to election spending, dirty money from politics will not disappear.
It proposes a comprehensive control of the system for the allocation of public procurement and the financing of the parties:
If this story drew an image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends all those who mock him to look at his own backyard...
'Strong 'PSG is not FC Barcelona! Sorry'
This season, you and PSG have set a brand new pace.
How do you explain these developments?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals have gone into each other or a completely new dimension of PSG.
Big players came to us.
Every day, I get next to them.
The tech team helped me a lot.
Every day these facts allow me to raise the level of the game.
And it's easier with matches.
Everything's going so fast in football.
I don't lose my head.
Ever since I started in preparation in the INF Clairefontaine until after the transfer to the Saints-Etienne, I have always considered individual degrees.
So you're using the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti introduced...
Reinforcements from this summer are used to play games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it shows that a player like me has a greater appetite for the match and wants to make maximum performance.
Besides, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my status.
He has assists, such as Claude Makelele, who used to play in the same post as me.
And does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all the technicians.
He has no equal in 1st league today and is among the best European coaches.
He has a huge experience and the top teams have won a lot of titles.
He also worked with outstanding players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
I had a comforting conversation with him in January.
I had a number of injuries.
The trust it gives me is another reason for my performance.
How are you looking at the first part of the PSG season?
In 1 league, Lyon took our lead.
But we remain in tow.
One of our main goals is the A-League: We very easily went to the eight finals.
What's your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Anything can happen now.
But we definitely want to be a tough opponent for good European teams.
We want to first win their qualifying group before Porte so we can play in retaliation for the eight finals at home.
Can PSG be a big European club in the short term?
The budget already has...
For Paris to become a big European club, it must win titles and write to history.
This is not the case today.
On the financial page, PSG have the means to make this work.
And would a big failure not win in the 1-year-old as last season's season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win a league title this year.
We've missed a lot in last year's season.
We were disappointed in May because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We picked up 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had a season even more amazing.
I think this year will lead.
Even though the title is also sought by great teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have weapons to beat them.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It's not unusual to expect a lot from us in terms of what has been invested here and what we have players.
We totally accept that.
It's a fact that when we beat Troyes 4-0 at home, and there's still something to blame in the papers, it's not very pleasant.
You ask what people may want more from you.
You can't, of course, win 4-0 on every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Masters, we proved that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who have not been through to the eight finals for the second season, yet also invested large sums!
Given the invested drought, you might expect to have 15 points ahead of the rest of the rest!
That's insulting the other clubs and the French league.
The clubs of Lyon and Marseille, which were too failing in last year's season, have moved to the next stage with the new PSG.
This shows how the 1-League is amazing.
I hope to be able to smile in May and say that, despite all the difficulties, we have managed to win.
It seems as if PSG have all relied on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It's a good thing to say there's a leftover addiction to Zlatan Auctions'.
That means Ibrahimovic is very efficient and that he gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and proves he's the star of the A-League.
Everywhere he went, he proved he was a big player, a world star.
We respect a man and a player in our team.
He also respects the people he has around him.
What he has achieved is really special.
This has led others to increase their own levels of the game.
Thiago Silva, who belongs to the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow alongside.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French representation?
As disappointing.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately for the injury, I couldn't play as I would have imagined.
But I've been through it and I've come out stronger.
I am also managing to play good matches today.
And that's what I've been hoping for since my appointment.
We have learned from what has happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves to be exemplary.
How are you looking at first-month Didier Deschampse at the head of the national team?
He speaks for the results.
We're in a good place in qualifying for MS.
The coach picks top, he's close to the players and can get excited for the win.
Such was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.
Is the rep-LRB- 1-1-RRB-of-16 October in Spain a solid start-up game?
This game has given us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
I have not experienced such a struggle before this shock in Spain.
Thanks to Bitcoin, you can pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs among beneficiaries.
Moreover, as is often true in these technologies, there is an obvious political outlook: The belief that the existing financial system built on bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto-LRB- a pseudonym-RRB-, represents both virtual money-LRB- transferrable to dollars, the euro... -RRB-, so secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between the partners' partners.
About 200,000 transactions have already been registered with the 15,000 computers involved in the network.
About a thousand websites are already receiving bitcoin as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin first reached a maximum of $30 -LRB- 23 euros -RRB- in June 2011, five months later, it fell to $2, today moving to the border of about $10 -LRB- an overview of the courses is listed on the bitcoincharts.com-RRB-.
Compared to the world exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank - LRB- the ECB -RRB- is concerned about this fact in its report on virtual finance, published in October.
Bitcoin marks the venom of the most successful virtual money giveaways, stripping the competing dollar and the euro giveaways and grabs the equivalent of current money giveaways.
Bitcoin differs from the other types of virtual money by the fact that it is like the homemade credits of the squid used for the process in a video game that one acquires to a game or which can buy -LRB- and, sometimes, replace - RRB-.
The social network of Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But each month, the central authority controls and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes of the network of current accounts, controllers, issuers of money and buyers and sellers are all nodes.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is in fact between two electronic addresses using an e-mail.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, making it anonymous.
A file of information related to this transaction is electronically signed with a double-key encryption system.
Thus, the network can verify the validity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is possible to make sure that the bitcoins are exchanged in a public book of current accounts distributed across the network.
The key stage is to write this new transaction into this book.
It is done to resolve the mathematical task of the assigned computer, whose investigator, a temporary central banker, will have the right to finish this additional line.
This is a cutting-edge phase; i.e., the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
The wearables franchise will take a flick 'this new transaction and add a number to it, only then the whole of the left.'
The goal is to find the number that provides a specific print - LRB- a lot of zeros at the start of -RRB-.
Once that number is found, the other nodes will easily check its accuracy.
The transaction is then indestructible on a string of all other transactions; any adjustment would change the print.
If a user wanted to pay double the same money very quickly over the course of a fraud - LRB- to ten minutes -RRB-, the network will confirm only one of both transactions - the other will be abandoned, because each of them has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this remuneration is regularly separated by two, probably by the end of 2012.
But the number of bitcoins in circulation is so limited by the number of 21 million, but they can be divided up to 100 million, so the margin for the margin here is...
The difficulty of the given task also increases with increasing levels of calculation.
The network had already experienced its ups and downs.
The website, which provides services for Bitcoin, has been attacked and there has been a alienation of stored bitcoins.
Explaining The underlying loophole is not related to the protocol itself, the comedian 'assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, the company for payments to the real money used by the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibility of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Prominent players like Wikipedia reject donations of this nature.
Others, as a platform for the WordPress blog, are receiving them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed a book of current accounts and proved that almost 80% of bitcoin does not.
A huge rebate scam was launched in November.
Actress Reveals It has been replaced by $30,000, carving out Jon Holmquist, who works for the Coinabul to transform bitcoin into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the teaching book about this money, has great faith in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card - LRB- with real money - RRB- or contactless payment by mobile, but uses Bitcoin to verify transactions that make it cheaper.
In addition, the wearer manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easily set up by traders where new terminals or software is not needed.
All you have to do is tell the address that can be accessed by the footage Photograph and the Detectives', specifies Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems and switch to more horizontal systems.
Scoring spree Before Bitcoin passes, it's still going to take time, but 2013 could be crucial, polls predict.
Moreover, the ECB is assuming in its report a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan-LRB- Kapisa and Surobi-RRB-.
NATO and American troops should follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not expect everything from us.
The greatest harm has been inflicted on the Afghan countryside, which we have punished because we regarded them as terrorists.
And so are we, we lost 88 killed soldiers, and all those injuries and mutilations.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but are often peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even when jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks have joined them.
They are now experiencing tolerance and frequent assistance from local insurgents, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The departure of the French troops from the foundations of Nijrab, which I have watched from the peaks of the mountains planted with almonds thanks to French loans, has passed in an orderly fashion.
Convoys of lorries and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without being attacked for aerial surveillance by helicopter.
Since the end of 2014, in Kabul, the Taliban will not be so active.
Since their unstoppable procedure between 1994 and 1996, conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty then, and the earth was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between various resistance groups.
Their takeover of control over the country was then seen as its kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the tutors of these peasants, which was dominated by the Al-Qaeda-linked organization, but their situation has not improved.
The former Mujahideen, the Afghan government, and current Taliban leaders agree to keep women in a subordinate position.
The major dignitaries from the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became profiteers, empowered by state land, which they sold as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge US contracts for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; most of them have never been in combat.
From what I've heard in campaigns, people yearn for a government not to form thieves.
Many young people want to go away as those who have been able to use American largesse: Capital flight is considerable.
The young is tired of war and the associated ideology.
They have recognized the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, and its advantages have been taken.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; there are currently 5 million people living in Kabul, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full, there are girls and boys.
These young people will have to be given a job, they no longer want to go back to the tweaks of earlier parties or the corruption of some officials.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; TV and Turkish shows that show the modern world, they watch everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that stand up to her forehead be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already renewing provincial militias that will be out of control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence on local identity, should enjoy some degree of decentralization along the lines of Western states, but the US wanted to transform it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so there was a repeal of the post of prime minister, which existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially not at the election scheduled for April 2014.
But its country has been significantly dependent on foreign aid since the 1950 "s and previous years.
No industry has been restored, no dam is working, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, just fruit and vegetables.
A private initiative takes precedence.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumors that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
And that only fueled the sense that the Western states were here only to capture it.
With no energy to process iron ore or copper on the site and without the means to transport raw materials over the mountains, however, there can be no extraction of minerals.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the mine to copper Mes Aynak and left the international archaeological teams - LRB- for supporting the World Bank - RRB - the chance to explore a vast Buddhist campus to retain the role of the most important employer in the entire province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, depending on the bulk of both imports and exports, will also need to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation contract foresees the continuation of common types of aid: Girls and boys' lycees, French universities, French institutes, military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative has worked to gain the heart and soul of Singaporeans seeking the difficult task of reconciling aid and army activities, in which the service has been instrumental in the civil-military action of the "Defense of Defense" -LRB- Cimic-RRB-, which was abolished in 2012, but achieved through a myriad of French NGOs, a series of achievements in the area of common interest and steps for agricultural renewal in dozens of mountain villages.
These work, involving a number of local workers, helped dampen the insurgency: Irrigation, wells, drinking water, woodland, fruit trees, soil protection, and the expansion of the cultivated area.
What kind of memory do we leave after two billion euros of Army spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very challenging in these valleys, which are often at an altitude of over 2,000 m.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for minor agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free these farmers from the insurgency led by foreign groups, they wish to achieve little civic assistance in their favor, which would be properly controlled and touched directly.
Difficult work on Egypt's constitution
President Muhammad Mursi has embarked on another game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history because of the publication of the constitution, which temporarily grants him unlimited powers, he has decided to play the Sabbath.
He announced on Wednesday, regardless of the opinion of all others, that the constituent assembly would approve the final text.
Less than a week ago, the Head of State granted this assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has used a makeshift text that has been supplemented many times, weakening the country's constitutional stability and leading to legal arguments.
This new initiative has further strengthened the country's ambivalence.
From the point of view of the opposition, the president remains in his glamorous autocratic delirium, continues to placate his word "kangaroo," and gibberish is trampled by law enforcement. "
His supporters, however, assure that it is a means of moving as quickly as possible with the constitutional and political crisis and accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks.
It is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intent of the text of the Egyptians to clarify the article after the article.
For the president, it is also a way to re-achieve national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country is mentioned by protests.
As he confirmed in an interview with the American Journal of Time, Muhammad Mursi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote for it.
Especially since this hastily organised vote puts the Egyptian people in front of the ultimatum: Divergent Reveals You will approve my text, or I will retain unlimited powers of subpoena "that otherwise should be terminated after the approval of the new constitution.
And in this special air yesterday, 85 members of the disputed constituent assembly with a large majority of Islamists approved the text.
Most Liberals were absent from the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the constitution was announced, they slammed the door with not being able to assert their views.
Defenders of human rights, civil society, or members of religious minorities have imitated their move.
In order to achieve the quorum's ability, 11 people from the alternate members were hurriedly followed up yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, the articles of the constitution were often voted out unanimously.
The commentators have been further suspended over the fact that one of the many disputes that day was around... the clock for prayer, when some members of the committee held the view that the hours in the boardroom were not properly managed.
The text, which was voted on last night, is made up of 234 articles.
The object of general attention, Article 2, remains ultimately identical to the version of the 1971 constitution, and stipulates that Singaporean principles of Sharia law are the main source of birthright.
The Salafi Party, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, was hoping to replace the term giveaways of the 'Reason' term giveaway rules of the subpoena ', which would allow for more stringent application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article was not corrected represents a sign of their goodwill and respect for the other parts of the Egyptian society.
Explaining the hypocrisy of the prank, he directed the Liberals, who see only a rhetorical problem in that.
For their part, the Islamization of the constitution is under way through other articles.
In particular, they focus on Article 220, which confers on the University of Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular for issues of control of the conformity of Sharia law.
According to the expert on Egypt, Sophie Pommier is unsettling because Singaporeans called for comment are not chosen and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of theocracy.
Liberals are even more fueled by the fact that the next university president should be less moderate than the incumbent.
Emotional remediation has not shown any particular religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a basic civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulamas, but university workers, many of them studied in French schools, Singaporean concerns Alexis Blouet, who is preparing work on a constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, it agrees that there may be contradictions about the interpretation of Article 220, since the dates in which the dates used belong to the religious lexicon.
There is, in particular, a reference to homemade fiqh giveaways -LSB- Islamic legal science, note-to-RSB-.
And in the future, there may be a question of the extent to which civilian judges are competent to comment on this.
Yesterday, the approved text is highly criticised in addition to the religious pages because of the extended powers conferred by the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant constraint on the former regime.
Another contentious place: The powers given to the military.
In line with the wishes of the military, the defence budget will not be carried out by parliament, but by the National Defense Council.
Moreover, the military courts will not be banned from driving with civilians, as the human rights association has called for.
These associations speak in connection with the text, which they believe is directed against freedom, of their doubts.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and the insult continues to be banned, which could have serious implications for freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
Nor does any article deal with the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In its view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
That word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While Egypt's president was due to speak in a televised address last night, a rally is scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of the state will then rally on Saturday.
In Israel, they are waiting for Ukrainian tourists holy places, the belly of the world and the sea from a saturated salt solution
The promised land combines the size of biblical truths, modern comforts, and incongruous nature.
AAF has identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Bow to holy places
To visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that on all those who enter this Singaporean soak, he will descend on God's mercy.
And Galilean - instead of Jesus' miracles: Turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
The faithful here will go through the Road of Pain, or Jesus Cross Road - LRB- Latin Via Dolorosa -RRB-.
He begins at the fort of Antonio - Pretoria - where the court was held, walks the streets of Old Town and leads to the Temple of God's tomb on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the crucifixion, to the stone of the anointing, and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here lies the symbolic Christian belly of a world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on a place where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which they made a cross to Jesus' crucifixion.
In Jerusalem, there is also the most sacred place for Jews - Wall of the Nazis, the rest of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 1970.
According to tradition here, people of different faiths leave notes with cards that will then be filled in.
Make your way to the vertical
The ruins of Fort Masada remained secret shelter from the enemy that Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
The ruins are located on a cliff in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who deal with mountaineering can access it.
Others will take a landowner on this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600- 2040 m there is a well-known ski resort of Hermon, which is experiencing a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
To this ski paradise, it conveys tourists from the bottom of the hill of the shuttle bus.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legends, the heathen gods lived on top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are around 300 museums in this country.
You won't be able to visit all of them in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is located near the Knesset - LRB- parliament -RRB-.
In it, ancient Kumar manuscripts, or scrolls from the Dead Sea, were found in the caves of the Judd Desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
There is also the Museum of Art in Tel- Aviv.
In its exposure, its slices are widely represented by impressionists and expresionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon, you can visit the museum-spa Al Basha, which visitors represent a few rooms of the ancient Turkish baths with the dummy users of spa and spa nurses from that time.
In Caesarean, it is worth visiting a unique private museum, Ralli, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenirs.
Admission is free and donations are strictly rejected.
The Fifth Museum - the Museum of the Holocaust, or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells of one of the most dramatic aspects of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built to commemorate 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk in - and you find yourself in total darkness.
The stars are glittering.
And the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improve your health
The three main spa centres of Israel are being broken down on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers pools, accolades, delfinaria and oceanarium.
Interestingly, it can be bathed in the Red Sea during the winter months, as the water temperature in it is not dropping below 21 degrees Celsius and the air heating up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and people buy in it for a year.
The dead sea, by the way, is the most peculiar sea in the world, located in the lowest continental point of the planet - at 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is saturated with saline, which is easy to maintain on the surface and those who can't swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Get here to treat the use of saline-salt water - salt water, and the medicine that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, inflammation of the bronchitis, diabetes, to cure the poached nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It protects the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the coast of the Mediterranean.
Through them, she was going through a famous sea trip linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
References to this city are in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, which they then shared a long and happy life together.
Tourists, indeed, love the vagaries of the tiny alleys, named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say that if you press down to the walls in the alleyway, you'll be able to see your mark, your luck will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarean - in the city of King Herod - you can go through the Roman theatre and the Singaporeans conquer the riches' fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the headquarters of Roman prosecutors, including Pilate Ponte.
The carefully renovated theatre is used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Tourists, a word
If you go to Israel, you don't have to worry about your imperfect English: In this country, about 30% of the population speak Russian.
On the road, it's better to take money not in euros, but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for the checkout -LRB- now the 1 dollar is approximately 3.8 shekel -RRB-.
Urban transport is mainly buses, but in Jerusalem a speed tram and in the city of Haifa are the only metro line in the country with six stations connecting the lower city with the top.
Basically, it's an underground lane.
Travel by all kinds of urban public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can travel for 1.5 hours with the transfer.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening into the sunset on Saturday, it ceases to work on marketplaces, in stores and in public transport.
And on Sunday morning, the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you will only get a kosher meal: With the exception of pork, seafood, fish without scales and meals in which the combination of milk and meat is contained.
They offer a large selection of meals of lamb and beef, soup as well as dessert, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish porridge hummus, a variety of sorts of sauces, balls from minced chickpeas - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are very many bloodthirsty cats, who graciously cater to their appetites.
In the evening you can see them asleep on the roofs of parked cars.
Passing cats love crowded places, and they let go of every goodie.
Borrowing the car will cost from $37 per day - LRB- Hyundai Getz-RRB- to $188-LRB- Audi A6, Volvo S80-RRB- per day.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And borrowing the bike will cost around 15 shekels per day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed by numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists visited the world.
Recognizing the land and rest came the most citizens of the US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, and Ukraine.
The country promised to visit from January to October 2012 to 118,8 tis. Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before lifting visas on February 9, 2011.
Sneak peek the big and powerful kangaroo to announce it to Moscow: Emigrants save money for language
While MPs and human rights activists are still debating the mandatory language exams, in the country, there have already been fraudsters selling homemade counterfeit counterfeit 'certificates
13 million foreign workers are arriving in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmen.
Their only goal is to earn enough money to support families at home.
On December 1, the law entered into force, according to which every working migrant will be required to pass a test of Russian language.
Meanwhile, the rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and community economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, FMS promises that over time, the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the tests will consist not only of language knowledge, but also from Russian history and the foundations of the right.
Knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed for obtaining and extending the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where there is a Russian official language.
Nor are they subject to this law by the people who successfully achieved attrition and obtain an academic degree in the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
The benefit, conviction and protection of rights
A network of test sites will work under the auspices of Pushkin's Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can consist of tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers are open in Russia today.
The initiative to promote the introduction of testing has also been supported by MPs of the State Duma and FMS-LRB- Federal Migration Service - RRB-.
But before the law came into force, the protectors of human rights have often asked the question in the press: And what does it actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
So above all - they are responsible for migration services - it will make it possible to reduce the number of people suffering as a result of Singaporean work.'
Many people today talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains the chairman of FMS Russia in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be launched before their departure.
Only an organised recruitment system will allow for 90% to resolve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for emigrants without a profession, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without the knowledge of the language - he says with the conviction of the Sebelev - a future migrant is condemned to clashes with dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide a vindication of trespass in terrible, close-knit hostels in which he and dozens of others, such as himself, spend entire months without food and documents and slumping for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get many complaints from our migrant workers.
Singaporeans V their country they promise one, but after they arrive, they cheat, confiscate their passports, don't pay off the promised wages, the defender confirms the head of the taskforce of working migration of MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't swear!
The less that many of the citizens of Central Asian republics, who intend to go for work in Russia, recognize that they not only know the language of the country they want to get into, but they do not even have the experience of the work.
Of course, it is not so much their fault, as the misfortune: Very few Turks, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least a reasonable basic education.
After all, their families also need something to feed the children, not to mention the fact that they need to be dress-up, round and equip them to school.
As children reach their working age, they must prepare for work on the first occasion.
Without the knowledge of the language, it's hard - they admit.
Sneak peek Feel the humiliation and inferiority.
It is true that, in the light of the Law on language testing, human rights defenders point to one important matter.
Testing will only be carried out for those migrants who have legal standing.
If they don't have it, they won't even be taking exams, nor are they going to get any more official work.
In the meantime, most migrant workers live as much as ever in Russia illegally.
Kangaroo Reveals Welcome, or Unpermitted entry disabled
Many of the incoming workers argue that it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all those language difficulties.
Legalization, in addition, costs money: From 12 to 16,000 rubles.
But false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police officers know that we have basically fake documents, no registration, and hence the blackmail cases.
Singaporeans Requires a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea, giveaways - he shared with journalists about his experience of citizen Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.
Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting of woman'
On the first day of the law on the language, it was found that the fake deals were not only the evidence of migrants on registration.
The FMS staff have already seized several false certificates of graduate language testing.
Counterfeit papers are printed on a plain coloured printer.
Of course, they didn't get to the new owners for free: Each of the migrants in the hope of making it so easy to run the tests, he paid seven thousand rubles for that document.
That is two-and-a-half times higher than completing an official test: That will cost migrant workers three thousand rubles.
Thus, the primary task of the immediate future is to safeguard the system from corruption, so that workers cannot simply buy the papers, in which government officials and human rights defenders agree.
Meanwhile, government agencies can promise foreign workers who failed the tests at the first time, the time required to take a course on the basis of Russian language.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are supposed to work in areas where active negotiations with humans are not required.
MVD -LRB- Ministry of Interior -RRB- not taking into circulation an illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes with the use of legally-held weapons is very low
The MVD of Russia is presenting a proposal to tighten the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
It is the government's response to recent events: There have been instances of shooting at weddings that have passed without casualties, and the massacre by Moscow-based lawyer Dmitri Vinograd, whose result has killed seven people.
Police want to ban the wearing of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which you can obtain a licence to carry guns - from 18 to 21.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarovaya, who promised that changes to the weapons bill would be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem on the way of homemade tightening of the screws'.
There was an open letter in the network, whose authors - representatives of various social gun organizations - demanded a rejection of the foolhardy of the absurd tightening of the transcript of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and a criminalist in an interview with Russian editorial in the BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, 142 crimes were committed in the six months of 2012 using firearms registered by the Ministry of the Interior, while a total of 1168 000 crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced, tightening the legislation in the area of civil weapons, not to get the perpetrators to go to a Singaporean black kangaroo 'market.
In their words, they can currently find any weapon at low cost in Moscow.
Currently, the Interior Ministry says that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: From race to officers
Footage of the Black Players' market with weapons is being supplied by several channels.
The main channels are five, says the colonel in retired Victor Baranev, who worked for a decade at the Department of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshots of sites receiving weapons orders
The first of them - a Singaporean army or military pathway critic ', that means a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
Footage VERDICT has been stolen by Russian officers and the Kavkazans themselves, the kangaroo says.
Another type of homemade black weapon squid 'are weapons stolen by criminals at security forces.
The barrage explains that it also includes stealing from police warehouses as well as weapons stolen directly from employees of law enforcement agencies.
Illegal giveaways mainly cater 'get on sale from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, there are often explosions.

They bring their contribution in the words of Barance as well as arms manufacturers.
Defender Voters There are currently private arms companies that are not competitive in the international market, and are scrapping weapons that are supplying to the black market, including Moscow, the critic 'says this expert.

A particularly large number of guns and automakers come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
Chilling REPORTER There is their production, sometimes the weapons are produced in the painting, and the mafia, which organized their smooth production, explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun?
Experts have calculated the approximate proportion of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons to a Singaporean black kangaroo market.
A report on the issue was processed in 2011 by the Centre for Analysis of Problems and Project Management.
Specialists have dismantled the statements by the Department of Homeland Security and the Russian Bureau of Statistics, criminological literature and data portals aimed at the tempest of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers report, come from military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons have been found on the black market by Singaporeans due to official officials whose work is linked to arms, the kangaroo says in the report.
According to the data provided by the researchers, 17% of the guns come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases there has been a theft of weapons in their production, 5% is a homemade black archaeology critic '.
A prolific-consultant one of the arms dealer, who asked not to be taught by his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the excavation of black homemade archaeology addicts have not been purchased long ago - they are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, sellers go for new shipments directly into military warehouses.
In spite of the Ensign, the buyer will buy a unit, like the TT pistol.

And now I can get there through a man I'm sure.
He'll only deliver them to me, too, because he knows I won't.

In the US, fast-food workers and supermarkets are on strike
Work on treasuries establishment giveaways McDonald steals' passes up to a quarter of all US teenagers
In recent days, in America, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in the hypermarkets of Walmart, and in the restaurants of the popular chains of fast food, such as homemade McDonald's, homemade homemade Burger King carving, homemade homemade Taco Bell Photographer, a homemade homemade Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise.
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will change to a wave of ninth, or whether it is destined to die soon.
This whole share is supported by unions and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest salary cap paid by rank-and-file workers in Walmart and in fast-food systems, the organisers of the protests will be able to reach them in their trade unions.
At the moment, this economic sector is virtually untouched by the union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, in the so-called lunchtime black Friday lunchtime, when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, engulfing millions of residents and, in some cases, was accompanied by fights.
On this day, some workers at Walmart, in which it works at 2.2 million people worldwide, abandoned their workplaces and demonstrated together with the union and left-wing activists of multinational trade chains, whose goods are destined for the lower and middle class.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are, on average, 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many low-wage workers at the Walmart store shop only at their work.
Availability and assortment of goods have made the Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
In the words of critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply in part because few pay their employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions such as the lack of automatic carriages or hand scanners.
Demonstrators on Auxiliary Black Friday interns demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company rose sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart worker gets $9.5 an hour, but that does not correspond to the height of the spending, say employees.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley illustrate that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
It is, on average, 1.1% more than this company spends on salaries now.
If Walmart moves to increase wages fully to the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers will spend about $12.39 more than today.
The defenders of Walmart point out that the protest was held only in nine countries and society should not cause virtually no harm.
Footage leaked Black Friday lunchtime in the company's stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items of goods per second.
Overall, her coffers were carried out in a glamorous black Friday scoring 'nearly 100 million transactions.
Representative Dan Fogelman said in an interview on the left-wing-focused website, Huffington Post, that the jobs left a total giveaway less than five Singaporeans "employees of Walmart, and that the protest was all a foolhardy other media sensor scam that was organized by the unions.
Sneak peek unoccupied cashier! Father'
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not the trading houses of Walmart-LRB- those in that progressive city aren't very popular, and that's why they're almost not -RRB- but homemade McDonald giveaways and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says it sells billions of portions, and then you don't even pay sick sick and don't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the city council in New York
He currently makes the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal law and the state of New York $7.25 an hour.
Fast-food restaurants gradually increase that wage, but only slightly, and on average they get their rank-and-file workers in New York $8.90 an hour.
In this precious city, no one has a lower wage.
I don't understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Employed at lunchtime McDonald Auctions' passes almost a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the counter after school part-time and live with their parents.
Few people are seeing their main source of livelihood or planning to stay there for a long time.
At the moment, I'm constantly meeting in an interview with workers stripping McDonald freaks' who complain they have to live out of this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal, a comment is hanging, whose author notes that it's irresponsible to have children if you don't know how to feed them.
The protesters, which began at 6: 30 a.m. on Thursday at the dunk by McDonald Auctions' on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the treasurer and chefs in the fast-food business start to receive at least $15 an hour, more than twice their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be founded in the sphere of fast food.
US laws prohibit the administration from preventing the establishment of trade unions and punishing trade union activists by bullying and layoffs.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier.
However, it is also difficult to implement in the business of fast-food trade unions for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the extremely high turnover of staff.
Disapproval
On this day, noisy protests were also held in a number of other low-cost restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of that event was at lunchtime at the Curiosity of McDonald Auctions' near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the city council Jumaane Williams, who said: 'McDonald's' says it sells billions of portions, and then you don't even pay sick leave and don't pay you properly for your honest work! .'
The demonstrators have received support from other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said that Singaporeans must work together to promote fast-food workers in order to achieve fair rewards for their work and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American sphere of fast food.
But only a few hundred people took part in it, though far from all of them were employees of a fast-food restaurant employing tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will become a spark that ignites the flame of the mass movement is so far unclear.
'Congratulations' is going to be the brains of the 'mediocrity'.
Among fans of modern technology virtual reality is a popular theme of widespread reality; lately it has meant to see the world in particular over the edge of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer at its annual conference, Google demonstrated the work model of this news, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had filed the application for the relevant patent.
From an interview with the head of interactive 3D technology in the Cambridgeian laboratory of Microsoft, Izadim suggests that for scientists of this company, the glasses are already in the past.
It attracts perspective manipulation with virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
Please tell us what your research group is doing.
- We are killing the interaction of humans with machines, but at the same time we are trying to move the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity has so far stuck to the stage of working with pixels on the flat screen, most sometimes touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look at the 5-10 year forward and anticipate major changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox bracket and the Kinect sensor - that's a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without the Kinect sensors, because for all it is a very interesting possibility of steering by goal.
What else is waiting for us in the future?
- Not looking at the fact that the Kinect system has transmitted the interaction to the physical level, very much interaction still takes place on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved -LRB- the system accepts a larger amount of data - RRB-, but the output flow has not been particularly affected so far.
We're trying to change that, we're working on a really three-dimensional imaging system based on different technologies, including projectiles.
You need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around it.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate form.
And in the first place - to hell with those stupid helms of virtual reality!
What do you think about voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it?
- It cannot be regarded as a panacea - the issue of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others in our surroundings about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for controlling the facilities in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not the sweeping, just about such skilful, short ones.
The gesture would not be reduced by a camera device, but a bracelet that would follow the movements of the bones and muscles.
So far, it's big, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as a gesture + voice.
How?
- How do you ask me to give you this can of soda?
You say it and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that will be very difficult to discern.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what can or can't a machine in a given moment?
It's not necessary at all, but it's a rapprochement.
I think that in the near future, we will have to work primarily to develop new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can, for example, be laser sensors that provide a reasonably good depth resolution, that's very important.
- If you talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your demands for modern cameras?
Isn't today enough resolution, depth, or anything else?
- In essence, the current generation - that's what we can bounce back on in our work on three-dimensional detection.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at a rate of 1000 f apologising @ s.
But it's not just the megapixels themselves, but as maths and depth.
In the current view of the matter, all current technology is inadequate for us - that gives work to designers of algorithms.
So we have to remember not only the resolution in the axis of X and Y, but also Z.
So very important is also the speed, number of frames per second.
The human movement is fairly dynamic, and the current data flows of 30 frames per second are frankly a little bit, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes, from our lab in Redmond, has made a touchscreen with adjustable delay processing in length of 1 to 100 ms, with current, mass-produced sensors being closer to the second-value-LRB- 60-100 ms -RRB-.
Not everyone understands how much it affects a person's interaction with a machine.
For me, at work would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, I just don't need so much touch, but I need some shots per second.
- And increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- In the Kinect system, three Singaporean cameras are now used, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - the receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera - that's actually a visual band's current sensor.
It's not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or exacerbate it because it would magnify the required volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue system Kinect, play with the curvature of the location of the cameras and see how it will help in determining a three-dimensional position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft-LRB- unlike Google-RRB--did not present their glasses in public.
Do you not think that when it comes to the day-to-day use of the technology of widespread reality by special glasses, this is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, going out and constantly holding a smatphone in raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: The strongest option would be a homemade portable flick 'likeness of an extension of reality, when it would be possible on the basis of a platform to switch at any time from glasses to a smartphone, a design display, and further around.
Glasses - that's a very personal device, in that is their strength -LRB- private stuff only you see - RRB-, and at the same time a weakness - the widespread reality on your glasses doesn't allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the handling of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in the Hottest Iron Man franchise, but also to the ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point out: There is no touchline!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- I often say in my lectures that the widespread reality - that is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of tactile sensations might well be the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks - the use of the other hand as a particular kind of background for viewing.
In an excellent way, the pressure is compressing!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at adding palpable to these giveaways in the air of the squid '- for example, the interference of several directional ultrasonic beams at the defined point where the finger is found, it gives a palpable sense, but it's still very faint - as if you're blowing your toes.
There is also a bracelet on the wrist that affects the nerve endings in your fingers - also promising direction.
Have you tried to fool the brain?
To think that he feels what he seems to be feeling at the moment when he sees something?
That's a good idea.
Here, there is another challenge that will be fought for too long - how to get a man physically in a very cramped space to believe that he walks through an open, virtually endless space - we are also working on the concept of running track-LRB- not at all, as in the clubs -RRB-, moving platforms and also huge balls.
If the brain's deception becomes a target, the work is still for many years.
That's what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in utter beginnings.
Vats in lieu of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Explaining the Rosbalt quiz 'is a continuation of the project starring Petrofac's avant-garde critic', dedicated to citizens who are in the lead, are avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list have already been important figures in the art scene of St Petersburg, whose conquest transcends the city, often finding recognition in Europe without reaching the Inglewood Trust.
New hero embraces Rosbalt scoring 'is stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is all dressed in the red you see here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here at the fashion hospices and on the vernisrats.
The images of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exposed, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of purely social and philosophical kerosene storytellers, creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller - that's a conspicuous man of the Petrofac avant-garde of the late 1980s and early '90s.
In addition to being a city man, his appearance on the streets puts a smile on the face of citizens, heightening everyone's mood.
He recently picked up the bottle and became a kerosene flasher, because he'd mature into this complex role with all his bohemian life, philosophy, and image.
Cyril, why do you walk all over town in red and yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I took the red colour as a designer on account and image.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between the artist, the imageaker and the public.
Though it is generally true that everything that differs slightly from the gray, wakes up aggressively and awakens the bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at making conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is, above all, an invitation to debate.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition in the House of Culture at Nevsky, where my work has been exposed.
I understand what my path is.
Back then, a wave of old free unofficial artists and new, free types of artists could not be understood.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with post-gazers, who brought us to haunt the Pushkin 10 Auctions, and other waves were not.
It takes me to the theatre, the dressing, the music, to all the genres except the word.
- And it all merged in your art- clinic... - For me, it was important to find myself in the centre of the Peshawburg culture, where all the best forces of creativity should be assembled.
In 1995, I took the place to the Pushkin 10, and there before the redevelopment there was a music-art club, a bohemian club, the home of the peppery bohemians.
There it was born many: Nom, Tequila Jazz, remember how the shallots were brought in with the project starring Ucho Van Gogh.
Shnur and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, dressed in tight-fitting triplets, among them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became glamorous by the Leningrad premiere.
Trachtenberg led many programmes of halibut-galore times.
We gave them Trachtnberg, that started his great career, basic education and training from us.
Gallery Seeks D 137 Reveals', the club starring the Gribojedov - that's the doozy of Art Clinic.
This is where our working and stable guests have gone.
I am the hero of the last century, when culture has meant something.
In 2000, a survey was held in print, the special price was the giveaway People in our city premiere.
In the nomination of a Singaporean Artist of the Year of the Year, I was appointed, that ended my peak.
In new times under the old rules, the work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In the current years, it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- The works are distinctive in a recognisable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are the hits in which it is vividly captured by the actuality and the penetrating.
I'm going to have a programming exhibition hosted by the Russian Museum in the claustrophobic Museum.
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable today to be such a pain and a terrible thing.
But in the claustrophobia, it's all in the shadows.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, save the world by means of a totalitarian disguise in order.
Today, people meet according to clothes, navigate the outer mechanics, not the inner man.
Or maybe he can't shake his hand and we need to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by the transfer.
- We have seen you in the role of urban flasher. The Cultural City should have such a hero.
And who should be if not me?
And can commercial art be beautiful?
- In the present case, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There is a breakdown of cultures.
Previously, people went missing in a huddle, bohemian loved one, simple other people.
Today, everything has broken down on the micro-society, today it is very hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to like everyone.
You need to think about who you like.
He has every cultural hero of his 100 fans today.
And there will be a few thousand spectators at the Stasa Mikhailov!
- There will be fans, there is a sexually social sphere.
And there will be 300 people in cultural land and 10,000 will not come, and the result is less management, money, all of them.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one is fooled and they don't violate what's experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures that hung from one collector on the wall along with Falk and Larionov.
I started with images that people usually end up with.
Today, people often confuse notions.
They say: Culture minister, culture minister.
There is no culture of consumer, that is from elsewhere.
I am the man of the culture of the day before, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejecting money for drawing images.
And I am for such a culture.
Cyril, what's a shortage in Petyburke?
- Good experts on culture.
There is such a concept: An agent over culture.
But not all of them can address culture.
This was not the case in all of the time of the ranks of the tsar, but they understood that they understood that they needed to be supported by genuine experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in St Petersburg who might be experts, but they are tucked away in the corner because they are needed by the big experts who properly appreciate these experts and put them on the right path.
Today, the Vats are thriving.
The same Erart, but it differs from genuinely saying that not all modern art is accepted, there are artists who should look for other museums.
What do you think Petraburk is?
- Petyrburk - that is not the capital of culture, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is the right ground.
And on our mountain, art thrives.
We need cultural land, but there are more writers today than readers, that's wrong.
There are very many people in Europe who are inquisitive who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
For us, such a layer is weak.
We need art to become fashionable, as it was at the start of the last century.
The project is being carried out for the means of a grant by St.Petyrburke
Giving birth in space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collisions with a killer asteroid.
The caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board are making their way, looking for a replacement planet.
To save mankind, the main question arises: How do you maintain your birth under the conditions of weightlessness or on that alternate planet?
I don't think the selection is very big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be adopted, even if only hypothetically.
Directing Photographs It's Venus and Mars, starring a senior scientist at the State Astronomical Institute of P. K. Shternberg-LRB- SAIŠ -RRB- Vladimir Surdin.
But while there are better conditions for life on Mars, the surface of Venus reaches temperatures of 500 degrees Celsius.
Living there is only possible at high altitude or in orbit of Venus... in space.
To deal with the question of reproduction in space, scientists have started with the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments on plants were made.
Four generations of castles grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
Then the insects were carried out into orbit - a very small fruit fly Drosophila.
In 1979, a quail egg was sent to the universe to verify how the embryo was being developed in a weightless state.
We get an absolutely normal bird on the climb.
But then the problems begin.
Chilling VERDICT Vicious problem with this bird has to find a foothold, must stand on its own feet and start moving, scoring a leading lab at the Institute of Biomedical Problems -LRB- IBMP -RRB- RAN Vladimir Sychev.
If they don't find a foothold, the birds are running erratically, and they make molasses.
After 10 hours, fresh-hatched birds came to an utter extinction of instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was that within four days they had simply perished.
Adorable flick Twice we let hatched birds, but then we refused, because it's just impossible to work there with them, texting the failure of an experiment with chickens in the universe, Vladimir Sychev.
The last sneak peek of the mini-arch of the squid 'animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
In a biosatelite kangaroo Bion kangaroo, however, they will only be beings of one sex.
There was an experiment with rats who had already been broadcast into space.
Basically, they didn't discover anything supernatural.
Chilling VERDICT It was only at the biosas, but again - this is a unique experiment and such attempts need to be carried out, defender 'says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on the ground, a descendant was born.
But it has not been possible to approach the issue of reproduction directly in the universe.
It's a tough job.
Animals at the loss of the usual environment simply cannot carry out their sexual instinct.
Man, unlike animals, he can.
Homo sapiens rule in abstract thinking and is able to create an adequate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not done.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest danger was Tereshkova.
The most precious thing humanity has is a woman's body.
Our Chaka flew away, and no one on Earth could tell whether it would last the flight to space.
Whether he can give birth to a child after that flight.
Chilling VERDICT There was no response to this question yet, scoring a veteran of the rocket-and-space industry of the Vachtang Vachnadze.
In June of 1964, more than a year after flying into space, she gave birth to first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova's daughter.
The father of the child was also cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of the second female-cosmonaut Svetlana Savic, who had visited orbit twice and who had also worked in the open universe, was born in 1988.
But the risk remains.
We have just a few cosmonauts born after long years and grow the health of the offspring.
Internally, it can be dangerous even in orbital years, the squid 'says the astronaut-pilot, the Hero of the Soviet Union and the Hero of Russia's Valeriy Poljakov.
Yet humanity must inevitably seek new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, and artificial gravity.
The CPK's hydrolab is a compulsory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here in conditions with zero attraction, cosmonauts are embracing the habits needed to work in the open universe.
The water mimics the weightlessness.
Although for adults, the water is a comfortable but, in a way, a peculiar environment, for small children, it is a natural element.
The little ichthyanders seem to confirm that life on the ground comes from the ocean.
There is a link between having a baby on average 9 months in the mother's crop of water and that it is then easier for them to get on the water.
In principle, it is logical because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bath, only 2 weeks will expire.
Footage transcript That's very little to forget the baby's forgetting, texting 'says instructor swimming in newborn Marina Aksenova.
In short, if, for a newborn baby, the condition is weightless, then, for women, it is the natural inevitability of gravity, an attractive force.
In a state of weightlessness occurs very quickly to the trunk muscles, the muscles of the pelvis, the body's ability to break out the foetus.
We can leave that aside as long as the muscles of the muscles work in childbirth.
After all, it is possible for the birth to be carried out in a special chamber in which the mother's mother will release the fetus.

On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If Earth's gravity does not operate, it cannot properly shape a skeleton or a system of muscle.
A newborn in orbit is not possible to dress as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he could train.
He will simply be stripped of what he absolutely needs to do to his development.
Apologising If we go with you to an experiment that concedes the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring to the Earth a disabled person who will be utterly unsuited to the environment, scoring the head of the board for bioethic IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.
So the birth of children in space today is just a theoretical question.
But there will be a time when it becomes a reality, and when earthlings go to a distant planet in their corals, it becomes the home of their descendants born in the universe.
Head of the NCA: Check hiccups failed due to politicians
In the context of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good control and good legislation, but it is lagging in its application.
In an interview with the update, says Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office of Miloslav Kala.
Singaporean Law will never be perfect, but it has to be the right of its apps - that's what we think is missing from us, the defender's comment on Kala's current situation.
Similar conclusions also suggest joint scrutiny of Czech and German inspectors.
As an example of the mispractice, Peter Neeld's approach to the so-called giveaways leak.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that ODIs would not bother him with his checks - so is he banned or allowed?
In fact, stripping the law must be set to be set, and, if anything, the Prime Minister can't prevent the office from being able to control and enforce the obligations of the Authority, the Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Chamber of Deputies in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke of a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was that?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, the idea is that European legislation governs how to deal with public procurement, followed by individual national legislation, and then the practice itself.
We have put this all together, and although the check is not yet finished, we have shown very interesting differences - in general, the legislation is also possible for us to become more rigorous and more sophisticated, but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to produce more and more precise rules, but the application of the law itself needs to be addressed.
What good can this project do for you?
Such joint control could help to stop our efforts to enforce laws, reducing and improving limits when it has no positive impact.
Economy means getting the corresponding thing beyond reasonable -LRB- but it doesn't always mean the lowest - RRB- price to eliminate enrichment and possibly criminal conduct.
But by cutting the contract, we don't necessarily achieve that.
Maybe the system will turn out to be such a bunch of leftover paper giveaways that those in that system want to look for holes in it, so they're going to draw a lot easier from it than if the limit remained higher.
You're talking about domestic issues with transferring legislation on public works into practice.
How does a system of control work in Germany?
Is the office similar to our NCA, or is it set differently?
As for the authorities, as well as the NCA, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized in the same way as we do, also has a college, only forms a different way, but in principle, the two authorities do likewise.
The powers, too, are similar to some extent, but because Germany has federal arrangements, it has these accounting courts, and at the level of the individual Länder - that makes the system a little different from ours.
The BRH can only control the federal money, for us introduced by state funds.
The public funds, which are managed by the county and communities, are controlled there from the level of the federal accounting courts.
As far as the legislation goes, that's easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some ways Germany is described as a role model, but it cannot be said to be better at all.
So is it even that they have better controllers?
I'm sure it's not, but I'm saying again, I don't like that kind of comparison.
But it has to be said that even the countries we regard as a model are struggling with a number of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be any good for them to cooperate with our office, right?
As for domestic legislation, what did you mean by the Public Procurement Act for your office, are there any consequences?
As the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it is not yet shown in the control actions.
Because we do ex-post controls, you need to expect some delays.
We are only observing this so far in the process of preparing future controls - we have started our new instrument scoring the risk-detection of the risks of uneconomism, despite which we have been propelling almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them - that's where the changes will, of course, be manifested, as there will be limits, the conditions of some types of competition will be adjusted and the like.
So, do you regard this law as a benefit or another burden on the bureaucracy?
I think this bill is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that can occur here is that the rules of the Singaporean tighten are tightened, and it won't be possible to keep them.
For the operation of previous rules, controlled persons are bound by the provider -LRB-, for example, in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council -RRB- to that any failure to comply with the Public Procurement Act implies a breach of budgetary discipline.
So, should the law be tightened in this way?
I think not in this way.
The system must rule out those who want to attack and abuse it, not punish those who commit a formal misconduct that does not have an impact on decision-making.
Such a system will put only more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of it?
Let's show ourselves where the road isn't going.
Recently, the Prime Minister has said that ODIs will not bother entrepreneurs with the checks of that so-called Singaporean giveaways - and what does that mean?
Hiccups are banned or allowed?
After all, the law must be set, and if it bans something, then neither the Prime Minister can prevent the office of an office under an obligation to control and enforce obligations.
He can say, "We'll change that law and we'll let it go," but he can't say we're going to do it, like nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, there are fairly strict rules on how to be formally implemented - which is right to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when candidates with the best offer are excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it has to be the right of its apps - that's what we think is missing from us.
Roads are frozen in places, mostly but downhill
In several parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowy.
But for the most part, the road is downhill, somewhere with caution.
Karlovarský Region
In the Karlovar region, the roads were downhill this morning, but at times freezing and also snowy.
The temperature dropped between five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day it is supposed to be slightly warming.
The snow in the region has ceased and there is only a weak layer in the lowlands.
But there are around 30 inches of snow on the mountains of the Krusty Mountains.
There was also lower visibility due to fog, resulting from data dispatching regional road workers.
R6 speed roads and first-class communication are now fare-free in the region.
Caution is in place, for example, on certain brides, where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
All roads of the second and third classes, including mountain roads, are also available.
But, in some sections, there is still a residue of frozen and humid snow.
Especially in higher positions, attention needs to be paid.
Pardubice and the Queensland Government
On some roads in the eastern Bohemia there is a risk of icing, in higher positions and in the mountains, a layer of snow may be on the roads, informing roads and highways on its website.
Road drivers warn the driver before icing, may form particularly in the upper reaches of the Parisian region.
The resort may be in the vicinity of Lanshhail, Ústí nad Orlina, Polika, Svitav or High Met, in particular on the roads of other and third classes.
Chemically they are treated to the roads I giveaway @ 43 and I giveaway @ 34 at Svitav.
Snow is mainly on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Eagle Mountains.
The snow layer is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of the Speech and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia today, it is most often clear to half-clear with no precipitation.
Temperatures are usually between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, a weak wind blows.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Plateau area are downhill this morning, but places with caution and driving need to be adapted to weather.
This is chilly in the morning, temperatures ranging between three to nine degrees below freezing.
After earlier snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communication may be frozen.
In places, drivers must also count on the fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
It comes from information dispatching regional hardliners.
The D5 motorway is sedated almost without restriction, but caution is recommended by traffic controllers between 80 to 131 kilometres.
Most of the first-class roads have the surface dry and ejected.
But the southern Plateau and Tachovsk can be frozen stretches.
Communication of the second and third classes are damp, and in this case, attention is paid to frozen stretches.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less fabled roads in the area of Fiddler.
Olomouc Region
The snow ducks on the road must now count drivers heading to the highest reaches of the Olomouc region.
After a chemical sprinkling, she was left on the Red Mountain saddle and on the road in the direction of the Videl Cross.
The road to the ground came out at night's snowfall, with roughly three centimetres on Sept.
In other parts of the region, the road is mostly downhill without restriction.
Debris sinks On Sept lying in the top of the remains of snow.
With a snow duck on the Red Mountain saddle, drivers have to count in the direction of Jeseník, the broadcaster said today's Tory dispatcher of the Swansea Highway Administration.
In the field at night, their colleagues went to Jesenick, the way up to ae's highest positions now, according to them, after the chemical treatment was bare and wet.
In Olomouc, roads are packed without restrictions; however, on Shternberg, drivers should be wary of forest sections, where the roads have remained moist.
Ústecký kraj, Liberace Region
Several difficult destinations are reported today after the morning of the hardliners in the north of Bohemia.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, a mountain road from Telnice to Knínice is also closed, resulting from a police database.
Temperatures also hold in the lower reaches below zero, so both ice and snow seem to be on the roads. In the plains, especially southeast of the Czech Republic, there are no problems, and the roads are usually dry.
The operating complications are not yet reported.
The incidence of the glacier is reported by road drivers in particular from around Happiness.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for her at night - overnight rain and melting snow, clear and cold at night.
Out of the main moves, adverse conditions are also reported on the road I climbs @ 13 on the sidelines of the Ústí and Liberal region.
The closure of Telnice on the Quartet forced the bent branches of the trees that had bent down to the pavement under the nose of the snow.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts, we want to gather positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarms that we humans like to catch.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can muster enough positive energy to delay or prevent the world's end.
In December, you will also hold an absolutely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you tell the readers closer to him?
This is a national fundraising event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the mayoral calendar reported on December 21 at 11: 10 a.m.
The day before December 20, from 21 hours, there will be 3 concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will be about at a time when the Republic of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the time zone 12 hours ahead, will end the mayoral calendar.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we made it all up with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to assembling enough positive energy and avoiding the end of the world, we and the public also want to think about what shape the world will be given to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world whose purchase at www.e- tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other performers, has also dubbed the so-called anthem against the end of the world called the Sculp.'
Is it very popular on YouTube today, it also sounds at these benefit concerts?
Of course, in full conclusion, that is, if we do everything and the end of the world doesn't happen...
It will be sung by all performers at all three concerts concurrently.
The anthem is also suddenly connected in a unique live broadcast on Czech television.
The words to this song wrote and the principal role of Jesus in the clip is played by Thomas Hansky, singing in it also xindl X...
How did you get along with them?
We also work with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we are hosting a lot of fundraising events and concerts...
We are trying to engage them intensively in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in working with us and having fun.
What will the proceeds of the concerts go against at the end of the world?
At the equipment-free education center Studeo, which is already the sixth year we have been implementing the Tap Civil Society in the One Direction Institute.
Behind the school's students, the lecturers regularly reach out to the lecturers and engage in activities that enjoy and interest them.
The students themselves don't have the means to go for the lecturers themselves, we try to allow them to do that in that way.
As part of the building of the Jedburgh Institute in the future, there will be a separate building that we are going to move into with this project.
There will be several musical groups and performers at each concert.
How did you choose them?
We've been trying to build a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Dry.
All details shall be read at the www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning some sort of homemade bombastic action for grabs' even in the future?
In May, we will be performing on the Prague Spring for the first time, so we will certainly prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests.
In the next year, we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and personally, if we're already in the US, I'd love to link it up with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist; you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London, or Moscow, for example.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group that makes up handicapped people.
How do you manage these paths logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems.
We have five members on the electric trolley, its trucks must travel in the luggage area, and we carry large amounts of cargo and boxes with tools, of course...
However, so far, it has always been done with no problems, CSA and British Airways have been well prepared for us, that I have been surprised how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we came back recently, that was no problem.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how the individual differs in the barriers, access to the public to the handicapped and the like.
What have you met so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places where everything works better than us, we have seen in Russia that everything in the east is still in complete beginnings.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is very much a barrier, here it is still unusual for a man in an electric cart himself to move in the centre of the city.
They don't even apply the obvious ones, like the coaches you prefer in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already civil associations that are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what on the contrary do we still have to catch up with more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we're still falling behind...
But it is important to mention that improvements and improvements in the situation are always dependent on the efforts of people involved.
In London and in Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe hendips individually to move in public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
But it's not uncommon for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in which we are, on the other hand, with The Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respect for the public or the barriers is one thing, but only when we're going to be major athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things are going to start to change for real.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have strong will.
The band The Tap Tap is very popular at the moment, but let's go back a few years back, what prompted you to set it up in 1998?
I came in as a governess to Jedburgh's constitution, where I had many young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I'm playing the saxophone myself, so I, uh, I hooked up with a colleague.
Well, over time, as our moderator Love Angelovic said, a little bit out of hand -LRB- laugh -RRB-.
But popularity has come up in recent years, or am I wrong?
It's true that it helped us when we started to connect with known singers and also actively work to promote the band.
We figured out that work that's not seen, it's basically like it doesn't exist.
Moreover, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lecturers, equipment, and so on.
Was your goal of doing it with The Tap Tap this high?
From the start, I felt the potential to do something differently.
Showbusiness is crowded with things where one mimics the other.
It's logical in its own way, everything new is taken with caution, and it takes a long time.
Things that are rare are very few, but I daresay Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of the person who sees us for the first time is, of course, pity, that's natural...
But the regret is totally unnecessary, because people with hendikes are not suffering from all the abandoned beings we have to regret.
These are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided they have the means to do so.
I say if something can be done to people with a handicap, that's not a move just for them, but for the whole society.
Has this success also helped that you're a strict boss, how many people have labelled you?
When we want to do a good job, we have to be uncompromising on many things and require some discipline.
But that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and with their heads in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to the test twice a week, there's going to be a product and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, so the enthusiasm will leave them quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and who wants to achieve something.
Currently, band The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were at her beginnings in 1998?
Only One Love, Angelovich.
We're an open group, people leave and come, it can't be prevented.
Who has the will and the taste is always the door open to us
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday, 20.12.2012 from 21 p.m.
It will take place in Prague Incheba Arena, Brně Fice and Ostrava Gas, for the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities will be linked by telebridge at the end of the evening in the joint singing of the band The Tap Tap Sculp.'
The aim of the concert is to gather funds for the equipment of a multi-functional free-access education centre STUDEO at the Jedburgh Institute in Prague, in a volume of CZK 25 million
Admission to the concert is £400, children under 12-year-olds have free tickets in pre-sale Bohemiatfork
Poland and the cosmos.
In the last week, Poland, a twentieth member of the European Space Agency, was taken to a meeting of the European Space Agency's ministers, as the second country from the former Eastern Bloc-LRB- to the Czech Republic, which became a full-fledged member of the ESA on November 12, 2008 - RRB-.
Poland launched close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and has participated in a number of projects in the Agency over the next years.
But Poland's trip to the cosmos began much earlier.
Flights to the cosmos have been devoted to Polish enthusiasts before World War II; but they have not always been met with comprehension.
For example, I am reminded of a lecture by A. Shternfeld in the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which, on December 6, 1933, presented ideas from its pioneering work into the cosmonaut.
The thoughts of the young engineer-LRB- nar. 1905-RRB- left listeners cold, and after years, Shternfeld remembered that only Dr. John Gadomski was interested in his work.
Shternfeld, in 1934, earned an entry into the cosmonauts in France the award of Robert Esnalus-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch.
The recall doctor John Gadomski-LRB- 1899 - 1966 -RRB- later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books dedicated to these science disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned astronaut promoter, and his contribution was appreciated even by one of the craters on the dark side of the moon was named on his behalf.
In 1925, a rolling trolley was built in Poland to be fitted with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately the author of the proposal is not known and is not known for the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should have been used for the roll-out of the trolley or for its braking.
Information about this dredging is known only from the good press.
Since 1933, missile launchers have begun to fend off Polish artillery.
The research was provided by Komórka Techniki Uarmajenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolf and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegim.
It is clear from the finished materials that the research has reached a stage of practical tests.
But the arrival of German troops was interrupted.
In 1937, a draft photoelectric fighter, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the professional press, and the following year, the work of Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomb Lotnicza author Leliwy- Krzywoblocký - was published in the following year.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all the projects of the military use of missile technology were devoted to the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee - LRB- Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo- Naukowy - RRB-, which co-ordinated all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years its activities ended the start of the war.
Other work dedicated to the cosmonaut is appearing after the war in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish astronauts -LRB- Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne -RRB-.
For the first time, there is a reference to the company in the November edition of the 1954 journal Problem, in which there are four more obscure articles dedicated to the astronaut.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicz, it is designed to create a society that will deal with the cosmonaut.
At the time, the projects of the artificial satellites were breaking down, and it was clear that space exploration was a prospective giant.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish astronaut - LRB- PTA - RRB- endeavor to join the International Astronaut Federation -LRB- based 1951-RRB- and has already become a full member of the PTA in the fall.
And in the following year, the first chairman of PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz-LRB- 1902 - 1959-RRB - became Vice-President of the International Astronautics Federation.
He held that job until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has made a significant contribution to the development of the very successful meteorological missile of RM-LRB- Rakieta Meteorologico-RRB-, which became the first Polish missile to undertake scientific research.
The first type of RM1 was completed in 1957 and the first takeoff occurred on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a climb of 1800 metres was about 80 cm long, and its weight was less than 5 pounds.
Later, the improved version of RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, two-stage RM2 rockets were launched in the Bice Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 feet long, and its mass was about 11.5 pounds.
Another development type was supposed to be capable of actual scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had up to 14.5 km and its job was to monitor the height of the wind.
However, in 1962, further developments were suspended.
The aftermath of the first RM-type rockets became Meteor1 developing between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the start weight was 32.5 pounds.
There were three types of -LRB- marked Meteor- 1A, -1B and -1c -RRB- that differed in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
In the Meteor- 1A rocket, there was an area of 0.4 liter, Meteor- 1B by volume of 0.34 liter and Meteor- 1C by 0.62 litre.
The maximum range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, in the Letesky Institute, the development of the Meteor-2 rocket, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload weighing 10 kg to a height of around 60 km.
Subsequently, a version of Meteor- 2H and Meteor-3 were built.
We still need to mention Poland's entry to the COSPARU-LRB- Committee for Space Research -RRB- in 1960, and the creation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
Poland also participated in the Intercosm program in space on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became a second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remke.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court abolished the law on public works.
The resolution provoked a lively discussion in public.
Certainly, it will be interesting to see the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic services, national economic systems, stand in a permanent conflict between them.
The cause is the principle of free trade and free, unrestrained movements of private capital, along with rampant financial speculation.
Due to the considerable differences in the cost of labor, -LRB- wages -RRB- there is a price tension.
Under this term, it is necessary to understand the situation where the producer is trying to import cheap goods into an economic competition by subjecting the incentive to a competitor of a competitor with a view to sticking to a larger market share and thereby increasing its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for the majority of entrepreneurs to either translate production abroad or buy cheap, or disappear. There is high unemployment in countries where labor prices are high compared to other economies.
Because private capital has no social responsibility, and thus the responsibility for it produced by unemployment, social expenditures of the state are bound to rise.
The whole situation enhances the unwillingness of the masters of entrepreneurs to pay taxes, thereby replacing the economic and social social damage that they have done in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that there is no need to specify specific statistical data.
Unscrupulous private equity practices create a situation in individual economies where national governments are forced to enter into competition with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments put private equity in private equity, regardless of the social downturn.
This is mainly reflected in changes in the laws in force.
The aim is to force economically to make its own population accepted by the price dictates of private capital, in particular in terms of wages.
This is both a constant economic compulsion in the case of long-term unemployment, as well as by limiting workers "rights in the field of employment law.
The result is growing poverty, coupled with an increase in the gap between the poor and the rich.
In the SRN there are already a number of years of public picking of food for poor people who cannot enjoy their own work.
The number of these people is coming to millions.
As part of an increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is common to cases that duly employed people receive such a wage that they must pay them to subsistence subsistence.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of auxiliary staff of the Federal Reserve.
The austerity of virtually all of the EU's southern states will undoubtedly lead to the same situation that people, under pressure from a disastrous fall in social level, are forced to either emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to live for hungry wages on the margins of society in the hope that a private equity capital will come into the country.
But here is the question, but where will it come from?
If it is from other EU countries, it will shift poverty from one country to another, or it will not come at all, for a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or a Turk, a Moroccan, or an Egyptian, or an African still working for a fraction of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the medium of frostbite claim that the state cannot take part in its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
The private equity market insists on the opinion that the State must not interfere with the economy.
Then, to ask whether private capital does not affect, it now drives politics, and the whole state in its own egotistical sense.
Here is a clear answer that yes.
Proof is the existence of virtually all-powerful and ubiquitous lobbies in every state.
The result is a desperate situation in terms of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation where it is virtually all reprehensible, but nothing criminal.
In the SRN, the situation is that the State Department for the lack of funding gives the drafting of bills to private legal firms that are lost in conjunction with the industry.
These draft laws are then agreed in the Bundestag.
All of this does not come from the people as they spell out the Western-type constitution, but from the financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal-minded democracies are now rapidly getting into the situation, as described by Appianos in their work by the Kriz Roman republic in the days of Caesar and Pompeii: Theirs' State has been in complete decay for a long time, and the authorities have been content with violence.
For bribes, illegally obtaining favors and using rocks or swords.
Bribery and corruption drove without any inhibitions, and the people went to vote with the predetermined voice of a critic, and, once, as a result of this disruption, it was, once, as a result of this disruption, to be, as a result of this disruption, to be, as a result of this disruption, to be, as a result of this disruption, to be, as a result of this breakdown, the fact that the only remedy in the bad situation was that the only remedy in the bad situation was to be chosen, and that it was necessary to choose the energetic torture.
Conclusion As in the antics, the current company is based on a reckless preference for self-interest regardless of social interest.
Private equity is, by its very nature, capable of understanding and applying a society-wide benefit.
The result is now, just as then, the unprecedented decadence of elites without any effort to reform a deeper nature.
As a result, the cascades of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes must be sought in the ruthless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state, the demise of these systems in favor of democracy of a liberal type can be regarded as a break with expectations of another round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that current elites are completely ignoring in the future the possible hundreds of thousands of casualties, humanitarian and social catastrophes that we now witness together with crimes against humanity, as we know them from old and new histories.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under pressure from competition both internationally and within the European level, the Czech Republic's government will have to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted politics--social reforms that strengthen the state's capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens in the government, and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: A laboratory of chaos.
Chilling Reveals Of Violence Nothing Ascents And Even You Can't Adorate 'Sting in the Song of Fragile, whose main verse in the refrain is ludicrously let's not forget how we are a fragile woman'
Tearful If my sons did not want war, there would be no giveaways of the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayera Amschela Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, a lot of reactions have sprung up.
One stands behind Israel, arguing its right to self-defense and the Palestinians grazing in the role of terrorists, others supporting the Palestinians, arguing the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide perpetrated on Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel grazing in the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is in the periodic repeating waves of killing the culprit and who is the victim, after all, today's people of Israel, including self-imposed territories, were born into the current political situation, and the onset of violence was not.
I'm about to offer readers a glimpse behind the curtain, a view of who, above all, serves the already 95-year-old tension -LRB- calculated from the Ballet's declaration in November 1917 -RRB- on a small piece of the Middle Eastern country.
Some of my considerations, supported by the historical facts, are derived from them on the basis of my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of modern history.
The history of humanity is, first and foremost, history of struggle for power.
In every epoch we can find some of that Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it has always been these personalities, who have been very autonomous in their actions and, or whether, behind their throne, someone who has directed their actions toward a predetermined goal.
We must recognize that we live at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power cannot occur in a generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families stands out one that might be considered the head of the octopus -LRB- if there is still someone above them I don't know, but I'm not ruling it out -RRB- - Rothschields.
It doesn't say much about them.
Of course.
The first press agency - LRB- Reuters -RRB- bought in the 1990 "s to stop the merging of its name with high-profile deeds in whose backgrounds they stood and which had always meant the consolidation of power, wealth generation, or both.
They have the main stakes in almost all of the world's central banks, and against countries where shares in the central bank are not being led or prepared by the war-LRB- before invading Afghanistan, the 7 countries, after invading Iraq, were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Qaddafi, but in the meantime, Russia undercut the central bank of the Russian government - RRB-.
Whoever tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank of Rothschield Bank of America, he began issuing his own -LRB- money and was murdered in 1865 in the theatre during the civil war.
JFK began issuing his own money and wanted to cancel the FED, was assassinated in 1963, an MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for unleashing a Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in 1859-1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars by Masons of the highest, 33rd degree of consecration by Albert Pike.
The first war was meant to remove the great monarchist state units in Europe, the other was to remove colonial estates in particular Great Britain, and the third is to lead to a reduction in the world's population of somewhere to 0.5-1 billion people - LRB- such a number of slaves for their comfort and luxury, and not consuming so many resources - RRB-, the creation of one universal religion - LRB- ekumenism is nothing but predicted for such a resolution - RRB- and a final takeover of absolute power.
The method that a group of the richest families in the lead-up to Rothschieldy is working is causing the crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution - LRB- order ab chao - order from the chaos of -RRB-.
But these solutions are false and lead always to a worsening situation - LRB- see the establishment of the FED to avoid crises like the one they caused in 1907-RRB-.
So after they were killed by the Hapsburg heir of the R- U throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo unleashed the world's first war, they destroyed the Tsar Russia by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
The World War I ended in sudden, militarily and economically unfounded, the surrender of Germany-LRB- there was no need for war to destroy the Tsar Russia - RRB- and, in turn, there was a fragmentation of the Central European powers, the Uherska, Austria.
For the easier to unleash the Second World War, bankers were allowed to create a latent conflict of conflict by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, thereby creating an assumption of radicalization of impoverished masses, and then all they had to do was give the Germans strong enough, vindictive, and simple solutions to the Leader, and the creation of a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, as well as play down, the fifth column, in igniting the war's fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield instigated the Zionist movement, whose one branch sought to create a Jewish state, preferential in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as the capital of -LRB- return to Sion-RRB-.
Already mentioned by the Ballet's declaration, the assumption for mass immigration of Jews into Palestine began to occur in the first clashes with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks took place on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, if Hitler took off from a chain at which the international bankers had held him, or whatever he had done was difficult to fathom, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the camps created an assumption for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and, much as the war reparations of Germany were sent to the Second World War, an outbreak of war was created by the state of Israel.
If the international bankers can unleash it, the Jewish people, like that of the other, are the victims in the first line of fighting, now together with the Arab or general Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos not only within the country, but also internationally -LRB- consider just how sharply divided people are on the supporters and opponents of Israel-RRB-.
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where a grievance breeds a grievance in an endless chain of violence when, at the beginning of everything, was the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here there is a need to distinguish the simple people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, the international bankers are undermining people's choice in elections solely by their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist, an international banker loyal, a politician who is doing all he can to unleash the war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization for cooperation - LRB- China, India, Russia, Pakistan... -RRB-, has threatened to break into the global conflict, and, given the control of the Imp over the Hormuz Canal, which travels 20% of all the world's oil-LRB- the nautical corridor is only 2 miles wide -RRB- even to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light now appears to be the words that were uttered by David Rockefeller in 1994: Foolhardy Jedinak what we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order.
The new world order in their idea is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newly-born individual is implanted in the birth of a chip that makes him a totally controlled entity.
Chilling Adorable A forces all small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to be on their right hands or at the head of the brand, so that they can't buy or sell, who is not marked by the name of the beast or the digit of her name.
That needs to be understood: Who has reason to cast the numbers of the beast.
That number indicates a man and it's number six hundred and sixty-six.
Film Argo: When it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, he occupied a crowd of demonstrating Islamist students in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrow of the Shah of Mohammed Rézu the Lord, who fled to the US after the revolution, which was patron of his regime for decades to come.
There was no positive way for the US administration - to throw the Shah overboard, because it would undermine confidence in allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostage in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was not capable of reaching.
It was a blow for the prestige of the United States, which later deepened the fiasco of attempting to free the hostages by force.
Imprisoned diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations were mediated by the Algerian government.
Their fate at home triggered a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The debacle in Iran contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film directed by actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of that history that brought a tiny victory to America.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six staff had escaped from her.
After a complex period, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story - they went to Canadian passports as members of the film's staff, who were surveyed in the country for the filming of a sci-fi big movie.
A combination of genres
The plan, devised by an expert on Singaporean exfiltration of the "Tony Mendez," also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
For the legend to be credible, writing about the film project in specialist magazines, they hosted a press conference, the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memory of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of multiple genres.
On one side, a realistically connected political thriller, at the same time, the so-called vigilante caper film starring, the story of the vanquished piece, the undercut - an example of this can be a series of Danny's partners.
In the film, the mood swings - on one side of the documentary-based sequence from Tehran-LRB- in the caption sequence, is shown by the iconic well-being of the event as well as the way in which the same situations were shown in the film - the big differences in that are not -RRB-.
On the other side of the outlawed passage of Hollywood, negotiated with irony and a slight pitch.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and the other institutions - the men in suits, discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck, in a remarkable way, managed to restart his career.
The mocking actor became a respected director, and even his acting had ceased to be the subject of ironic remarks.
Argo is its third celery film, after dark cricket Gone Baby Gone-LRB- 2007-RRB- and thriller City-LRB- 2010 -RRB-.
At the same time, it's the first Affleck picture not being played in the director's home Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere was among the characteristics that the director's older films promoted above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows him in the Arg, where Tehran's Singaporeans play the franchise 'Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in reconstructing the real events - the opening sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time mediates the emotion of the confusion and disrepute that arise when, somewhere, a sweeping history is made.
The same effect Affleck and his collaborators achieve in scenes of fabricated -LRB- fake staff at Tehran's bazaar -RRB-.
Too many holes in too many places
The director has also had to deal with the fact that the telling story does not actually offer much in the film sense of the exciting scenes.
Quite successfully, he almost works with it, sometimes thinking something about reality - there's no way it's all so elegant - LRB- the scene in which the impending crisis at Tehran's airport will undo a call in America and the chase after the runway seems far-fetched.
But the weakness of Arga is a distraction from the need to show too much terror in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters would earn more space and aren't the only ones in that film.
Affleck's film is sort of losing a dramatic move, it's a snapshot that can be watched with a gentle interest, to appreciate the realisation and the retro-style evocative of the thrillers of the 1970s.
But it will be difficult.
As a reminder of one still in a way, live history and a document of how exaggerated the ideas of all-powerful and omniscient secret services will suffice.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The www.banknipayers website, which is announcing the poll on the most absurd bank levy each year, has now decided to declare a competition to cater to the most absurd regulations or ideas from the EU-led "scam."
Colombian defender Vedran us to that last event, when the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the leadership of the major European companies, the TaxPayers' Association organiser Patrick Nacher said.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, is the recent European Court decision to unify premium rates for men and women.
Meanwhile, women in the life insurance policies have been favoured because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
Divergent Reveals Other incredible ideas from the EU's workshop may make people nominated by the end of this year.
The vote will then take place by the end of February 2013, the broadcaster informed Nacher.
The controversial EU regulations include the mandatory incorporation of biosfuel into fuel, which in turn is harmful to nature, further banning the use of reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain a relatively small amount of dangerous substance, or a directive on the size of chicken cages, due to significantly healthier eggs this year.
The backlash has also faced a de facto ban on using the term poppy butter or the removal of classic bulbs from the sale.
Quality bananas are supposed to have 14 centimetres
The EU apparatus is often decided under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels usually defends a state or a group of states -LRB- so the Czech Republic now even the threat of a veto promotes the demands of its banks -RRB-.
The interests of the lobby were also behind the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to be at least 14 cm in the Union and were not allowed to show homemade anomalous curvature of the squid.
In doing so, the European Commission has resisted that it merely harmonises the existing non-uniform national standards that have complicated trading.
Standards concerning fruit and vegetables have already been amended by the EU over the backlash of some states, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
A candidate for victory in the Antos can also be the EU's EU regulation, according to which it must be made aware that children under 8 years of age must not be inflated without adult supervision.
The EU has appealed for US research into which balloons among toys are the leading cause of the death of children to suffocate.
Such restrictions now apply to children under the age of 14 when whisked in the pouches.
Quaint ideas are born at home
Quite absurd, then, is the rule concerning European officials themselves - anyone who has any official function in the EU can, in view of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece, use the name of Macedonia and must instead talk to the FYROM-LRB- Colombian Republic of Macedonia-RRB-.
In collaboration with the association of liberal economists, Laissez Faire, the Bank of the Liberal Economists nominated the poll in addition to some of the above-mentioned absurdity of the EU regulations on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has established maximum quantities of food stocks that could be located in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, fixed volumes for canned mushrooms, with a high fine.
The organisers of the poll have also taken the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea, and the idea of granting subsidies on a request to receive a subsidy.
However, these ideas did not arise in Brussels, but in Prague.
We are handicapped by the fact that we don't have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund, in the fall of 2004, the Minister for Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas -LRB- - RRB-.
As an argument, he said that much of the grain had been born to us and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, was to become full of the warehouses he had to export.
The EU should have paid hundreds of millions of euros in the wake of the Czech Republic.
Finally, the European Commission has stepped up the Czech Republic to organise a tendon to buy grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy to get the subsidy offered to the municipalities for local development managed by Minister Paul Nemts- LRB- US- RRB-, specifically, was to go on to write a request for a subsidy from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
While regulations are easily targeted in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate, as well as the more effective functioning and development of the entire Union, are worthy of recognition, according to a number of experts.
A more serious problem, according to experts, for example, is drawing up EU subsidies for projects that do not have a sign of anything to do with the deepening of European integration, but which have been enforced by the Member States in the budgetary negotiations.
Emotions among the Czechs also show that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic has to fight for the right to a specific designation of its traditional products in Brussels, and not always succeed in this match.
After a six-year battle with the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs defended the name of an olfactory-shaped pyramid, but a domestic rum whose tradition dates back to the 19th century had to be renamed home to our manufacturer.
The name of the rum can only be borne by cane products, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered EU products in the world-known cheeses of feta and gorgonzola, marzipan from the German Lübeck or Parma ham, for example, have already found carlovara biscuits, Pohořelické and Třeboňský kapr i žatecký chmel.
The EU trade mark may also be proud of the steamed percussion and the mustard tubes.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how do you think he wants to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If this has worked without problems in our country, I'm not going anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the last twenty years of the country cut, as the thieves run, people raise taxes as well as the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to come up with a solution to change that.
And since I was forty years old, and I'm an independent outsider, I have no other way of influencing things than running for a senator or a president.
You got to the Senate, but you went to Castle.
Don't you turn your back on the people who elected you?
All the time, I was saying that I would go into the battle for Castle by the outcome in the Senate election.
I later clarified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not function, function is a tool as I can carry out my visions.
That is why I need the greatest influence and strongest mandate.
But the problem is not only that as a nation we are in the pub and on television, but that we will stamp out anyone who wants to try to change.
To do this is to add to the media that dehoneses humans, and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For me, it was claimed that I bribed the journalist or that I was an adviser to George Parouth.
Let's go to your rounds.
In the battle for Castle, you set out with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and the back-up assets over twenty million.
You have to change the law.
But as president, you have no such authority, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I was a citizen lobbying for the guide to be free to live, it managed to get through.
The problem is politicking - if someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, it will deliberately be rejected, and it delays the citizens.
As an independent outsider, I have much more potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My preference is that, without partisan greats and dogmas, I can take something that is best for our country, from each side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself to be a man of right-wing or left-wing?
From the Czech perspective, it seems to me that people are taking me to the left.
It's not important to me at all, if a little to the left or a little to the right.
For me, it's important that we go forward.
I am not concerned about whether one belongs to the left or the right, but I want to associate people.
I will always support any public good solutions, even if it is proposed by KSČM or ODIs, and I will be against the bad idea anyway.
You draw when someone tells you you're a populist.
But don't you prove what you said?
When you create a bystander at the company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
Someone might call it populism, but all the suggestions I'm talking about are already working in the world, or major experts have been talking about them.
But without the support of parliament, you will be left with nothing but passwords.
And you won't make it in politics in the long term.
Or do you think if you're going to see people and talk to them that you can get through a criminal and physical responsibility, for example?
I have no choice.
To persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on their side to put it through.
If I was elected president, there is no problem to arrange a television direct transfer, where I will ask the president of the parliamentary parties to enact a substantive and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to say why they don't want it.
If there is a strong personality that will be naming the necessities, it can be pushed to the political scene.
Take a direct election of the president, that was a credit to public pressure.
Frankly, I'm an amateur. I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
For my views and vision, I try to look for allies.
I have only just begun in politics, and I will try to get majority support for my program.
I try to move things by myself, if I don't, I'll be done in six years, and I'll go back to the private sector.
It sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything in one person, so I've circumvented a number of well-known people whether they would also run for the Senate.
I went to Radiem Janchura, he declined because of the amount of work.
So, at least, I supported the investigative journalist Jane Lorenzo, who sparked fraud with light heating oil.
I was running for people who are really dissatisfied, but now I'm on the weigh-ins.
Sixty percent of the people were not elected, and those who went were mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we're just two independents.
People have elected the Senate so that the changes will be difficult to enforce.
Yet I will fight for my visions, such as a direct choice of mayors or flocks.
Are you thinking of setting up your own party?
I haven't thought about that yet because I don't have time to scrutinise the clean past of any potential party, and I don't even have the money to do that.
I don't have the money or the presidential campaign, there's only 20 grand in my transparent account.
Don't you have money?
You're talking about property admission, what's yours?
I estimate private property about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a land of about 25 million, an apartment in ten million, another apartment in eight million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million, and a total of $1 million in a million dollars, and then I have a couple of millions in my account.
By the way, Aston Martin I have because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove in the car, was gallant to women, and also fought against wickets and necessities.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have assets for $60 million, and you don't have money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million to campaign.
Am I supposed to be in debt?
I've racked up 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors is indicative that there's no such interest in my programme.
And I have no obligation to campaign on my own.
The cost of the campaign will basically cover what I'll be getting Senator's salary.
But I wouldn't make it out of him, for example, I couldn't pay my son an English school that costs £30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I'm not running.
So you're going to keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you could dampen these activities?
But that has nothing to do with the salary.
As I promised, I have partially wiped out my activities.
For example, a travel agent will become my deputy in the spring.
People would want me to be a samaritan who's going to save the republic.
But I also need to live from something.
How many as an entrepreneur were you used to taking a month?
Two hundred to 400,000, which I take on.
And if I were president, I would end my business.
You will find the full interview in Saturday's edition of the Rights.
The architects of the MVRDV are proof that true adventures are not only played in the head - for example, Spijkenisse and recently built Mountain books - 2 shots
This building seems cheerful, it looks futuristic, and finally, there's something interesting to see, a tease says Lisette Verhaig, who goes around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technician at the close of the big business, mean: Congrats to Oall, that house is a nice one.'
But I'm asking what we need the library for today.
They all have the internet, iPads and electronic books.
None of these old-style libraries are on a voluntary basis today, are they?
Spijkenisse, a resident in close to Rotterdam without his own jobs not worth a visit, holds a special record.
This municipality of 80 000 inhabitants shows the lowest level of education throughout the Netherlands.
To address this silly situation, the decision was made several years ago to contribute to universal education, and to build seven nicely painted iron-concrete miniatures of fictional bridges that are carved on euro banknotes.
But the success of the education offensive was not dizzying.
And so city councillors recognized that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: We must have a library!
Winy Maas of the rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, a master of madly audacious column charts and a contractor of witty, often even cynical structures, adopted the thing with the usual calm and, at a competitive meeting in 2003, appeared with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the board was still dumbfounded around and shrugging, he drilled the cheeky Maas of his daysons on himself according to the size and his activist's reasoned speech ended in the words of a Singaporean Milan urban community!
So this is my proposal for a Game of Books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was worth 30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Mountain of Books was awarded the second-place transcript of the Best Library of NL 2012 Auctions.
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
A small-town grey that has yet to offer more than a post-modern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, behind whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy, is because of the richer of a bit of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural structure in the history of its existence.
Long journey to the book
First impressions: Reader eldorado under the cover of cheese.
The heat of the mountain drives a lift, but the real spatial and reader passions will be discovered only when they grow over the topography.
From all sides the glass interior is light and bright, the floor of a burnt duck, and the elegant street lanterns clear the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dog and boys and girls playing football.
And books, books, books.
Wearables Normally stands shelves of books along the façade, and in the middle is a big dark space that is mostly relentless and impersonal, texting 'says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down, and the space for the reader was ejected from the inside out.
The interior of the Mountain of Books is expertly used: There are offices, an internet library, a chess club, an ecological centre and a hub of house-building techniques on Wednesday.
The strange poise is the black shelf on the books, which are once lined with walls, once a parapest, and sometimes a railing of stairs.
The appearance, the structure and the smell feature civics.
Even sworn architects and construction engineers are circling the unknown building material.
Sneak peek We're here to work with recycled materials, texting 'says Joop Trouborst, head of project at the city community of Spijkenisse, on the inquiry of the Standard magazine.
And so we hit a suitable waste product of agriculture in one of the company's farm one day.
For many years, in the greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, it has been used as a foundation under the roots of a millimetre rouge of synthetic matter.
It is cheap and time-effective.
The thin texture lasts one, two seasons, and then is ripe for being thrown into bulk waste.
For the library, there was a shroud - for the first time in such a quantity - slicked on a plate of four centimetres thick.
The effect of heat and pressure with the so-called Landbouwplastic -LRB- KLP -RRB- turns into a dark, homogeneous and burdensome material that smells a little like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
You get to the top of the 105 stairs.
At the end of the nearly 500-foot-long putter, you will be rewarded in a literary cafe, not just a fantastic view of the city, but also Dutch crooks and figs in florets.
They care about the atmosphere, but mostly about the proper humidity in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a new soul
Sculpture Reveals You might not believe it, but this house is a demonstration project in spite of many glass plots, in terms of the ecology, the venom says Trouborst.
They get heated and cool the Earth's heat.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass hatch, the sun shines in just short, even in sunny days.
The wide leathery wooden vaults, which stand perpendicular to the glass facade, serve as eclipses and capture much of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest will handle the full automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptic from the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Also, a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who Boekenberg even describes as a Singaporean long-awaited soul hooker 'Spijkenisse.
Reason: Every resident of the city was invited to the opening several weeks ago to dedicate one book from its personal fund.
They should have been first filled with optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library, which currently holds 70,000 pieces.
The concept has worked.
The shelves are completely filled.
Glamorous Reveals There's nothing worse than half-empty library, scoring 'says architect Winy Maas.
Verdict Reveals I think that thanks to our invitation now, every resident has a relationship to the new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for decoration.
By doing so, MVRDV has been commissioned in the royal discipline, which in vocational jargon is called the shaping of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young and ignorant they are.
That is ultimately the starting point for identity.
Szabo: Singaporeans Germans must play a bigger role enough'
Germany abstained when deciding to adopt Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe, Stephen Szaba, Berlin is teetering on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first signaled early in the week that it would vote against the proposal for the observer status of Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he will support the US position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, too critical to Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about setting up a no-fly zone.
It was eventually settled by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that he is just changing his foreign policy, in the direction of a policy that was orchestrated by the US, towards German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult for Europeans to have a coherent and uniform policy.
So Germans are between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just settling in on their role, but they're on the way to scoring a more normal defender 'foreign policy.
Foreign policy that they have in France or the United Kingdom.
What, specifically, means stripping a normal Singaporean foreign policy from a German point of view?
It shows the readiness to take on national interests as well as positions that are independent of the attitudes of the US or the European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, exports and its relations with certain areas, like Russia, China, or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to some extent, different from the economic interests of other great powers, which is why Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests affect the stance in the Middle East conflict and vote at the UN?
First, Germany has large outlets in the Middle East, especially in the countries around the Persian Gulf.
That is why it must be careful not to frighten the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
That, in any case, plays a role.
But I would not want to attribute too much importance to this, it is not a completely one-sided relationship.
But, in any case, it plays an important role in German considerations.
Was Germany's relationship damaged with the US when Germany abstained in the case of both important decision-making, for example when voting for Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the US, there is a great deal of understanding for the German attitude.
That's why I don't think it was such a dramatic breakthrough as on Libya.
Perhaps Germany has even benefited from some respect.
It signals that it must be regarded as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are various views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The US has clearly spoken out for the veto.
Are there differences between the US and many European nations?
These differences existed as a result of American internal politics.
I think that the Obama administration is about to have a deep understanding of the European position.
But, as a result of the political situation, this stance cannot, of course, be held in public.
I don't think the differences in opinion really are as big as they always seem.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not much excited by Netanyahu's policies at all.
Isn't it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relationship with Israel and the US, on the one hand, and the position of the EU's most important partners on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes the Germans more difficult.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently happening.
So they cannot be part of the wider line, and instead, they must be pushing things forward from their own position.
That's what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take over leadership in the future and push Europe towards a European stance.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, for its relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive subject.
But I think the Germans are clear they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player?
Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable, and for this country, for obvious reasons, it is still hard to play a bigger role.
For example, when we look at a European crisis, when Germany adopts a larger role, anti-German sentiment will arise.
That's not easy for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: We don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It has to be acceptable to all sorts of neighbours and opinions and that's not easy.
The influence of the US in European policy now continues to decline, but the EU is currently not filling that vacuum.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they're uncomfortable and make them even more unpopular - caged la vie!

Pioneering Protect Protects Footage 'in China: When they're Puma and Armani suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this lies a sign that is officially registered in China, but it has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it shall enjoy protection as long as the true owners of the brand have been jailed.
And even then it is not clear whether the militia rights.
Footage critic For a foreigner, it is becoming increasingly difficult to protect in China of his brand, the critic 'says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the office of Taylor Wessing, who specialises in breaches of protection rights in the Far East.
Every week he lands a new case on my desk.
Counterfeiters just have a few more letters to claim their brands.
From the Gucci brand, for example, Luto Gucci, and instead of Prada, will be allowed to register with Prada-Kny.
In this way, German companies, like the manufacturer of sports goods Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a binder with the records of the Post Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, one Chinese firm left its business to protect Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also parasites on the fashionable house of Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are masters of the world in copying and violating intellectual property.
In major cities, there are multiple trading houses in which counterfeits are almost entirely sold.
But Pattley's cases are different, from the credentials of his Mandants to get the Chinese firm to receive an entirely official right to use a sign that is already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it a homemade Bang Mingpai squid, an associate brand.
This word focuses on Singaporean Bang Dakuan Auctions.
There are women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any blame.
Sneak peek It's a trade-off, we've got to sweat it, kangaroo calls for Pattloch.
Wearables Make it dilate, sole position disappears, damage image is tremendous.
Financial losses and court costs affected by branding go to millions, especially for expensive sample products.
According to market research company CLSA, China is with a volume of €15 billion per year of the world's third largest market for luxury goods and the market, which is growing fastest.
However, the listing of questionable records in the register of brands can be reached difficult and it costs something.
Driving can stretch for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court has dismissed lawsuits because the complaint's name became apparent after a long duration of Singaporean market reality giveaways.
When the plaintiff has bad luck, he has to pay the plagier yet because he damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there's the law of the jungle.
The known cases are also related to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the manufacturer of the construction machinery of Sana, a company that recently took over the German pump maker in the concrete mix of Putdouister.
So the Chinese are still allowed to use the emblem that resembles the star of Mercedes.
Geely, which was bought by Volvo, initially used a blue-white logo that resembled a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
The fashion-goods manufacturer Lacoste lost in China with counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the familiar crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any blame.
The Post Office of the CTMO admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 because of too small staff and space.
But in the past year, the allegedly giveaways of the work process returned from an emergency situation to normal.'
For example, the number of unprocessed objections has fallen by 22%.
There were 57 000 of those cases, 75 per cent higher than the previous year.
Still, there are still 81 500 complaints pending.
Something to do about it is expensive
As is often the case in China, these are impressing numbers.
Last year, more than 1.4 million mark protections were delivered to CTMO, almost one-third more than 2010.
That is a record, and it means that China's Podemos is leading the list of new applications worldwide.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were selected on charges.
It simplifies that each log-on average costs 1280 yuan, or €160.
To begin the case is a case of multiple occasions, as the case of the German family business, Freudenberg, shows.
This concert has been battling against Chinese plagiarism for more than seven years.
The Germans have achieved that its illegal production of imitated car parts has been cancelled.
However, the forger has secured Chinese law to mark Freudenberg as well.
We would have forgotten this because, in Germany, the surname cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The CTMO Authority also rejected the objection of the Munich-based company.
In the next two instances, a Freudenberg dominion of rights, however, the defendant is fighting further to this day.
You need to be very careful
Now the matter is being discussed in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the matter will lead to a good end and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: Directing the proceedings is extremely costly and cost us a lot of time, money and nerves.
Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the company's archives, they had to even examine a hundred years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg, in vain, offered a homemade high six-figure sum in euros of giveaways to settle the dispute.
You can see what it means to us, "Wentzler says.
There is a danger that the danger from the Far East will hit Europe.
And that's when the imitators get unprotected brands.
One Chinese producer, for example, wanted to sign Freudenberg for footwear and leather in Germany.
This area of business has long since given up, yet he was able to avert registration.
Chilling VERDICT You need to be very careful, hooker 'says Wentzler.
He and lawyer Pattloch advise German businesses to be very careful in dealing with China.
It's not enough to rely on international stamp rights. Foreigners would rather have extortionate everything in any way worth protecting, to sign up in China's giveaways, says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed: If Freudenberg in the last act of his drama with the brand succumbed, then I guess he will have to counter the licence fee for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed from the market in the controversial segment.
World War Against AIDS: Stomping, singing, help
In Heidelberg, the choir of Imbongi - and in Swaziland, are happy to have orphans after their parents who died of AIDS.
The story of a connection that surpasses much more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there is the stamping: Cowboy high boots, basketball shoes, women's boats and men's moccasins are looking at the parklands of tact and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then, slowly, the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - are pressing, waving and intertwined.
The 29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopfa almost rises from his textile boots as he combines the voices with his lucid wild gestures.
It's Monday night, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology at Heidelberg, a choir of Imbongi, a new song.
It came to fifty singers and singers between 23 and 69 years ago, from researcher human genetics to the janitor.
Sculpting the Omnitary Oban Sites' is not an easy track, each chorus voice has a different text, and an extra in a very foreign language - a Zulu that speaks to eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS program, estimates that around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
Of the 23.5 million lives in South Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245 000 orphans after the parents who died of AIDS.
HIV-positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after the parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esit, they found a spoof Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend a school of second grade.
A patron can be taken for 15 or 20 euros a month.
He guarantees a child's tuition, school uniform and one hot meal a day at Gogoto centre.
Imbongi means in the language of Zulu a Singaporean storyteller 'or a wannabe critic who praises enough'
No one can talk in this space, just to sing.
For almost a decade, a chorus of songs has been practiced in this foreign soft speech, and sometimes brings them back to where they originally come from: South Africa.
At an aerial distance of 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg, the village of Esitali is in the north-east of the League of Swaziland, which is dependent on the great powers of the German chorus.
Forty percent are infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in plain clay or straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents since they succumbed to HIV.
In Esite, you can see in the small, the hundredth of Swaziland: The highest rate of HIV infestations, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of a male precursor, which demonstrably reduces the risk of the disease by half, does not accept the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry a virus of debilitating immunity in itself, and it is not rare that they die in less than 30 years.
In the spring of 2005, the village found this village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but above all, Imbongi members saw many children on the streets lacking not only parental care, but everything: Food, clothes, education.
Without end-school education, they have no chance at all in the poor country.
Initially, it was still a private deployment of individuals, which for a few euros a year allowed to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
However, a year later, it was founded by a choir of Singaporeans Voices for Africa Auctions, which has since cared for orphans after parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
To the bacterial SPI belonging to syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea -LRB- gonorrhoea -RRB-.
Common Virus SPI is HIV, human papillomavira, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Mules and shrimps belong to a parasitic SPI.
Who belongs to the group most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur primarily in men having sex with men.
The Institute of Robert Kocha is based on the fact that at least four of the five all cases of syphilis, which have been reported in Germany, are relayed by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, they are sexually transmitted diseases that occur often, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis - LRB- fungus - RRB-, gonorrhea and human papillomavira.
HIV is prevalent among heterosexual adults, but roughly 20 percent of HIV-infected people fall on this group.
Among juveniles, chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently than in other groups of the population.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections concern young people from 15 to 25.
In addition, human papillomavira is often present among juveniles.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually communicable diseases must be reported.
The number of infected syphilis is more than doubled to 3698 illnesses in 2001, according to the condition of Robert Kocha, from 1697 of the disease in 2001.
The number of people newly infected with HIV has been declining since 2007.
There were around 2700 cases in 2011.
That's about one tenth less than the year before.
What signs do they point to the sex disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the area of genitalia, difficulty in urinating, outflow, pain in the lower abdomen as well as blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and will therefore not be seen.
How can you protect yourself?
The dangers of the disease can reduce condoms, but they do not offer 100 percent protection.
For the origins of sexually transmitted diseases may be partially transmitted by infection from impurities and narrow physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, particularly in the case of frequent rotation of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most SPI and prevent subsequent consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charitable donations, and last but not least the fees the choir will earn by singing throughout Germany will gather some money.
Sneak peek Total we have already sent around €200,000 to Esiten, the TaxPayers' Association chairwoman Annette Lennartz says.
The money from Germany runs in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman who can get through.
It also encourages orphaned children to find shelter, for example, for some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as he tells old women in the language of Zulu, is a mainstay of the village.
Some of them have taken 14 orphans, put a roof over their heads, and care for the children to attend school every day in time in their uniforms.
Children who no longer have one go to the shelter to Khanyisile, a lonely woman who pays the spoils as well as two cooks that cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, the Singaporean Voices for Africa franchise has set up a school of sewing, built two curators, and together with the US health organisation PSI has sparked that many people in the village have been left to take a HIV test.
Even if the disease is so obvious in the country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
Blaming AIDS is absolutely taboo, texting 'says Annette Lennartz, apologising because she has something to do with sexual'
In fact, pretty strange in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his ungentle lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-approved way of life also implies that the HIV virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But even the many migrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says condoms are on every corner for free, homemade gravy but no one is using them.
Culture is different - unprotected intercourse.
To at least support the cultural exchange, the Imbongi Corps travels once every two, three years together in South Africa, and sings songs full of grief, belligerence, confidence in the future, and the confidence of the black that many in the southern tip of the black continent know from the apartheid era.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the talk of blacks - such an award brings not only mood and joy, but also has already ruled out tears by many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esited, where the singers visit the children over whom they have patronage.
Even if you can hardly find this village on the maps, there is more than known in the Ezulweni valley.
Sneak peek Go to Esited, there's the light, the lyrics' say there's people.
And when you return to Heidelberg, who is from here an airliner of 8733 kilometers, to dusting singers in the service at Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light is shining here, too.
Messenger: NASA discovered on Mercury ice
The Messenger probe found evidence it was on the planet Mercury ice.
The ice sheet could have a thickness of up to 20 metres.
The US National Aviation Administration and Space Agency - LRB- NASA -RRB- demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Even when it comes closest to the Sun, there's also frozen water, as shown in the three studies published on Thursday by the expert magazine Informant Science Auctions.
The Messenger probe found evidence for that in the area of this planet, which lies in permanent shade, there is an ice blanket.
It is reportedly at least 30 centimetres and maybe even up to 20 metres strong.
This water came from the comet or perhaps from the asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let's not put the finding of ice into the existence of life on this planet, said leading scientists working on the probe of Messenger, Sean Solomon.
Mercury's temperature can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us clarify how water and other essential elements of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix, unguarded earthlings, are taking part in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they will send pictures to Earth, small windows into the endless gums.
The picture comes from a photographic instrument developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.

One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: A vortex galaxy
The images of the spiral galaxies, according to their colouring, become real art parts.
The footage released by the European Southern Observatory shows several thousand light-years from the Trifid Nebula in the constellation.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word gibberish triffus left' -LRB- divided into three parts, a triangular -RRB-, as the dark stripes of dust divide the glowing heart of this stellar birthing into three parts.

This 1400 light-years-distant nebula consists of dust grains that are ten to 100 times smaller than the usual household dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It displays a ring of black holes that are left 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called the UGC 1810 scientists.
There is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way in this stellar nebula.
The cradle of the stars gives rise to new additions.
Also, these star clouds, associated with the Rosette Nebula, are born with ever-new young stars, and are 5,000 light years away from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is still no dust, but only gas.
Scientists believe it was only formed shortly after the Big Bang when it was predominantly hydrogen in the entire universe.
Our views of the universe: The most important telescopes
The telescope reportedly invented 1608 Hans Lipperhey.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have ever been magnified - and the looks they have mediated are ever deeper.
The largest telescope in the world has been for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope at the Palomar Observatory in the vicinity of San Diego.
The mirror in this image had an average of five meters.
In American Arizona, the Large Binder Telescope.
It allows an insight into the universe using two mirrors, each with an average of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures at an average of 10.4 metres.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Yet his average reaches about 11 metres.
The disadvantage of the cheap method of construction: The telescope is secured by a hook at a height angle, limiting its mobility.
At the height angle, the Telescope of Hobby-Eberly in Texas is also fixed.
Its peculiarity is a high amplification of the luminous flux.
This, despite a relatively small average of the mirror, equals the world's largest mirror.
Using a radio telescope in Areciba-LRB- Puerto Rico -RRB- search scientists in space after alien signals.

There's a Very Large Telescope - and he's doing the honour of his name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can shine through the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large telescope is also planned for the Chilean observatories of the ESO.
Its main mirror is to have a full 42 meters and is composed of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
But the images can be counted as early as 2018.
Two of Keck's telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano, Mauna Kea, were considered the largest in the world by 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition to them, looks into space as well as using telescopes of Subaru and IRTTF.
Also on Mauna Kea, there is to be a new giant telescope - with a 30-foot diameter mirror.
Here you can admire it in the image.
But the most important impressions of the universe are mediated by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Footage of remote worlds has been providing us since April 24, 1990.
Kepler's space telescope has been searching since March 2009 after extrasolar planets - especially after those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets had been detected since the start of the mission.
The images are documented with final preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The space telescope of James Webb-LRB- JWST -RRB- will be fired into space by the Ariane5 rocket as soon as 2018.
The primary mirror of the space-based infrared telescope has an average of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescopes is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists are coming off the ice as well as the south pole of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable figures for this, as Messenger circles around this planet far closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements showed for decades to be on Mercury's ice.
Thanks to the probe of Messenger, which was sent in 2004 and is the first to circulate around Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink the butter daily and live to 168 years

In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the biblical age.
There's even a longevity museum.
Finding traces in a country where 97million people are still relatively young.
We can call it a wildly romantic ride.
The microbus is rattling along the road with many curves along the densely forested hills, ferocious rivers and simple piglets.
Everything is green and juicy, it almost seems like we're in Schwarzwald.
But this is the ultimate south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few miles away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group of Talyn lives, which is not much known, except that he speaks perfectly both Persian and Azerbaijani and reaches a very high age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town is being driven by too monumental architecture of Soviet times, which is somehow not suited to the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe don't come here.
Eight hours is required at 323 kilometres as the road is only one-lane.
The fairytale wealth for which the country owes oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the countryside.
However, Pilata Fatulayev -LRB- 48 -RRB- is convinced Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
Singaporean Baku in May has celebrated the Grand Prix of Eurovision - and we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world here next year, the Genocide says Fatulayev.
She's the director of the longevity museum, probably the only one in the world.
Here's a documented life of nearly eight dozen Talyls from around here who are over 100 years old. Fatulayev shows a black and white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At age 136, he still spawned a child.
However, the sport star of this museum is the shepherd of the sheep Şirali Müslümov, who reportedly was 168 years old.
The birth certificate does not exist.
And, given that the oldest person with the papers was 122 years old, Müslüm's age seems to be extremely questionable.
Footage starring Narodil in this area of 1805 and 1973 died, paramedics explain to Fatulayev.
This man was reportedly three times married and had 23 children.
So, were they mistaken by the Şirali Müslümov at their age by a couple of decades?
However, there was a Rembrandt Scholz in Central Asia, a Gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock.
Singaporeans are strikingly many people of the high age also live in some areas of China, in Japan or in the valley of the Hunza in Pakistan, the comedian 'says Scholz, Singaporeans also live in Sardinia, living extremely many very old men.
However, because of the missing background, no scientific evidence of age can be given, especially when it is missing from the registry.
Every day a glass of melted butter
But the fact is that people in the area around Lerik are living up to the biblical age strikingly often.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why does so many people live here in the south?
Azerbaijani's guide to Farid Mugimzadeh explains the specific genes of Talyn.
The director of Fatuljeev, on the other hand, believes that it consists of nutrition.
However, that just a caloric diet of Talyshis who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter each day, is so healthy, it does not seem plausible from the bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city of Lerik, lives by Rubaba Miryelwa.
At 97 years old, this latitude is still relatively young.
Mirscream, who claims to have 143 offspring, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a mint, which he tire relentlessly.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of Miranda's sons and a daughter.
Two small children are bouncing around.
In the kitchen, a tea is being prepared for guests, which is given in the typical venomous jars of homemade armadat squid '.
The white teeth of Mirscream make the perfect series, and under the scarf he hides the long dark blond braids that proudly casts her son in front of us.
I always washed my hair with milk so they didn't look and keep my colour.
Sneak Také I've never used shampoo, kangaroo says Mirscream.
The monthly pension to life is enough
She has always eaten what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I haven't bought food in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then he tells me about his man who was in the army.
The worst was in World War II.
But everything was improved when the village was taken over by Singaporean beloved father comedian 'Geydar Aliyev.
Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of the old woman.
But the cult that is being done around the figure of the Father of Nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then took over the village of his son, Ilham.
The old people in Azerbaijan at least do not suffer from noughties.
Mirscream receives a pension of 230 manatees - LRB- approximately the same amount in euros -RRB-. This is a circumstantial case from which you can live well.
And maybe he's right also a long-haired son of Mirjahideen: Singaporean Old people enjoy a great deal of respectability in our culture.
They live in the middle of a big family, they are loved, feathered and happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of Singaporean human rights critic 'in the constitution is missing
A revolution has returned to Cairo.
The popular demonstrations in Cairo have revealed the country's profound ambivalence.
There is a sharp discussion about a future constitution based on Sharia law.
Egypt's president did not save the pathos.
We have to make the transition.
Congrats And for being able to do that, I am responsible, in front of the people and before God, texting "said on state television.
His speech was determined by the whole nation, especially the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular people.
All of them, still hopelessly riddled with confused opposition, fear.
Fear in front of Singaporeans by the state of riches' on the Nile issued to the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi almost apologetically told him that he had temporarily reduced the authority of the constitutional court and extended those in order to save the Singaporean revolution.
But what a 61-year-old engineer who has the degree of a doctor at the American University of Southern California is really to save, the Egyptians and the world are not clear.
Should the judiciary be stripped of power?
The 234 paragraphs that stoked the constituent assembly with the overthrow of the Islamists were hastily approved in the 15-hour night marathon, partly to raise concern.
As in earlier exhibitions, he also says in this suggestion that the jurisdiction is based on the foolhardy principles of Islamic law giveaways.
But what does giveaways mean?
That was, and it is a matter of interpretation, and it can be feared that the Islamists will make this vague formulation, and with it, the associated legal free space will be used for a more rigorous interpretation of the charms.
At the very least, it illuminates the newly added paragraph: In all matters relating to charm, it is necessary to consult the university of al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with great influence on the whole Sunni Islam.
This may not, but it may mean that the cranium will exercise oversight of the legislature, which would give the justices a de facto withdrawal of self-righteousness.
There are many matters of interpretation in the draft constitution
The problem also is that the civilian jurisdiction of military courts remains to be maintained.
These courts have served as Mubarak's government to counter the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
As he stands in the proposal, the state should also protect the Singaporeans the true nature of the Egyptian family and to promote its morality and values of riches.
This is the legal aspect of the wording so inaccurately that, by virtue of this paragraph, state institutions can even control the content of the film's art and literature.
In a comprehensible speech, that means nothing more than censorship.
Indeed, no section in writing makes explicit equality between men and women.
But another article forbids the shame or slander of the Prophet Mohammed and his envoy.
But it remains unclear what is vilification and how it will be prosecuted.
Equally questionable, the wording is that it is forbidden to cater to people's insults.
In this case, is the caricature of the president or a joke on an expert's account?
The matter of interpretation, like much else in this proposal, which Mursi will put forward for signature and, in his words, will be a giveaway very soon to quiz the Egyptians for the sake of the popular vote.
Singaporean Revolution'
For weeks, the opposition has been shaping up against the odds of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual clip on Friday night in Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to destroy the constitutional document before it even began to pay.
Singaporean Revolutionary has returned, and we will win, the defender said Hamthann Sabbas, who ranked third in the presidential election.
The Nobel laureate and former director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradei, declared that the draft constitution belonged to a Singaporean on the scrapheap of the history of Singaporeans.
Through the service of short Twitter messages, he accused supporters of Morsi that they want to perform a vigilante coup against democracy giveaways.
Sneak peek If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him, the defender said of the Opposition Leader Yasir Said.
Outrage Reveals We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet punished, the outrage has been cited by Egyptian media opposition politician Khalid Ali.
Several judges have announced they do not want to keep an eye on the referendum, making it invalid.
Blasphemy Koran is our constitution give'
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood has declared a defiant demonstration, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
She was attended by many hooded women and supporters of the Salafists who called: Tearful Lid demanding the application of divine law.
They called for Mursi: Pioneering Clear the ground!
The battle for sovereignty over the symbolic Deputy Tahrir, on which it all began, would probably raise a state of similar civil war.
Morsi's supporters clearly didn't want to take any chances.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that the opponents, and the proponents of the draft constitution, were loudly and clearly expressed.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide which direction the country is to go.
Most in favor of the proposal for Islamists are regarded as some.
'Fascinating the Word of Human Rights' is not found once a woman'
An enforced constitutional dispute that should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, the robustness of Hafiz Abu Saints.
The 47-year-old human rights advocate and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights - LRB- EOHR -RRB- defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in jail or stood trial for Mubarak.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
In a new constitution now, there are no words to cater to human rights' not once, hooker 'complains in an interview for a Singaporean Welt am Sonntag hooker'.
Morsi's expansion of power to all three power components in the state has forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
Sincerely, Instead, in order to strengthen the president's civil society, he has effectively cancelled it, apologising to the Saints.
But democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
The Sainsda feels abandoned by the international community, which follows the struggle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could backfire.
A demonstrator in Tahrir Square warns: Walkie-talkies You've become a monster you can no longer control.
Norwegian coffins: The most smelly fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be associated with the local appetite for an extremely smelly fish?
Take some overripe cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football equipment.
Leave it for a week.
So you get to smell the paralyzing smell of the coffins, one of the biggest Norwegian offenders.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a wonderful view - and there is a pervasive smell in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout fermented in water for up to one year - depending on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and getting chilly, the Norwegians are starting here in Fagernes to meet at the festival dedicated to this, how to say it best, the most sublime meal.
Sneak a peek of it raw and then you'll drink it with a glass of aquavity, the hooker 'says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called extortionate Rakfisk general defender', who is responsible for the progress of the festival.
All around us people eat small cubes of fish and zip it with a large amount of alcohol.
Singaporeans Some people have an aquavit rather than a coffins, a kangaroo says Havard.
The potion can beat the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's a similar piece of sushi that was on a long journey by bus.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different era, when there was poverty in Norway, and because there were still no refrigerators, the fish struggled into airtight barrels of water and salt in the autumn.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well-fermented, pulled up and eaten - the senses were no doubt dulled by alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their land and search for work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
At the moment, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by a large amount of work, high earnings and a large-scale care system.
The inhabitants of Sweden, an old rival that was much richer than Norway, was flowing into the country for work.
In Rakfisk, it is seen as something important, indispensable, even if a rather zealous part of the Norwegian past.
They are among the more expensive dishes on the market.
Though expensive is everything - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you £9 -LRB- $14 -RRB- apiece.
Norway is often not in global news - and it seems that most people like it.
The name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremists who shot 77 men, women and children in the last year, here people still mention distaste.
Instead, the shooting is called a Singaporean event from July 22.
The Norwegians may find it hard to believe that in their peaceful country, one of them was capable of such brutality and slaughter.
Beyond Norway's current wealth lies the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970 "s.
Chilling VERDICT But oil isn't the only reason we're doing so well, Singaporeans say in the submission of plates with the upmarket coffins of our waitress Anna, who with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes represents a prototype of nordic welfare.
We are, as you say, thoughtful people.
Her English, as well as the English of most of the people here, is absolutely impeccable.
We're not getting ahead of ourselves, we don't like ostentatious.
Norway treats its oil wealth very carefully - in addition to a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund designed for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial crash was throwing away money that they did not have, the Norwegians had tight ties on their purse strings.
Sneak peek Until we can ski in the winter and go on trips in the summer, we're happy, Singaporeans says Anna.
Adorable kangaroo A to eat the coffins, the kangaroo delivers with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in the queue for something to eat - I've had enough of the coffins.
Such a moose burger is definitely something else, and it's beautifully succulent.
But tonight, the smelling fish is back.
The hotel I live in is one of the many places where coffins are given for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather to smell the most demanding fish.
They have that connection with a live television channel, in which the moderator with a butterfly is surrounded by a plate of coffins.
It's like the singing contest of Eurovision.
Sneak peek What scores do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thoreau-Juergen?
Sneak peek Here's our sting, Havard.
There's applause and laughter.
A man falls from a chair, maybe a morose aqueduct.
Or maybe fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico has a heavy start
As the incoming Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, he is looking at Will Grant from the BBC on the challenges he faces, and on the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city that is clogged even at the best of times, steel barriers have been erected, closing several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent commuting from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive a presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico, at the time of the presidency of the outgoing Felipe Calderon, has been well economically, but the country is in the wake of the drug war, which has already been estimated to have taken 60,000 lives in six years.
Singaporeans My government has a big commitment to the Mexican people in reducing the violence, citing President Pena Nieto American President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the start of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before he shook hands with the US president, President Pena Nieto gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Views on the new leader are different in his old homeland, the populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
Straight man.
For example, in the rural city of Valle del Bravo, they remember him in good.
Citizens attribute the development of tourism to the resort and build up infrastructure.
You can get to the city now after one of the new highways left by Pena Nieto to build. These highways are a huge improvement over raucous and bumpy roads that have been here before.
Records with his name also hang on the walls of the modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
Sincerely We Expect to bring in real and lasting change, the defender 'says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, the state MP for the party of President Pena Nieto, the Institutional Revolution-LRB- PRI-RRB-.
We are particularly hoping for interesting and real changes in the area of security and the economy that our country needs so badly.
After an uninterrupted 81 years in power, the party of the PRI was displaced by Victory Fox.
Mr Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the inside of the party from Enrique Pena Nieto is expected to do much.
And he refuses to express the opposition that characterizes the new president as a man without significant content.
He's a very forthright person, very impressed with the country's excellent vision.
He is a great statesman and, above all, he is a man who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression that many people have from its former governor.
In Heaven, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more apparent.
Tucked away under highway overruns in much of it resembles the outskirts of Mexico's capital city itself.
And the problems in the self-righteous community are also persistent and urban.
At the start of this year, the army was called in to help manage drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, particularly searing violence against women.
In the last two years alone, dozens of murdered women have been dumped in the barren places beside a vast waste dump.
By the time Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is synonymous with the murders of innocent women.
In a better case, critics of Pena Nieto say that, in his office in office, he failed to adequately address the problem of women's murders.
And in the worst case, his leadership is blamed for closing his eyes.
In a concrete house, typical of the dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows photographs of her late daughter, Mariany Luny, and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Marian committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes her partner murdered her.
Explaining the footage When I arrived at her house, it looked as if her body had been washed, the squid 'recalls Ms Buendia.
There were signs of strikes, and rigor mortis had begun.
As her mother tells the story, Marian stares down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which she is the only word: Glamorous Conviction Reason '.
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they have been denied.
The state authorities acted to me, as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker and a whimper.
They want you to just accept what they say and shut up.
Emotional VERDICT But that can't be right when there have been so many mistakes and omissions, texting says.
The gloom that President Pena Nieto receives on Saturday is accompanied by a great deal of responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by a violent crime, and the new president has promised to make his top priority during his tenure at the office.
Sincerely, I hope he will be the same president as he was governor, Singaporeans say in the Valle del Bravo Member of the PRI Olvera.
But that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill treatment, military prosecutor says
The military prosecutor is seeking to disprove the allegations made by Bradley Manning regarding gross treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in the city of Quantico in Virginia.
The defence wants the case to be rejected on the basis of gross treatment of Manning in prison.
Private is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
A military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of secret material in US history, has missed many opportunities to complain about the gross treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
The military prosecutor has, Ashden Fein, in cross-examination of Private Manning at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, in Maryland, claimed that the weekly visits that Manning had with the officers of the unit during the nine months of detention in Quantico were showing no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination, which occurred during the hearing carried out on the motion of the defence, to dismiss the case against Manning due to gross treatment at the time of custody, which is sufficient for itself, was carried out the day after Manning testified that he had contemplated suicide in custody.
An intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents while on his duty in Iraq.
The material was then published onstage at WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, a military prosecutor, Fein, went along with Manning the forms, which the officers filled out after meeting Manning at a detention centre in Quantico, where he was held in the regime with increased security from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers viewed Manning's questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday on these forms, Manning admitted that the treatment of his guards was rated as exquisitely exquisitely delicious' and the total treatment in the facility was rated as a giveaway by a very professional hooker '.
The forms do not show any complaints of ill-treatment, even when officers asked Manning directly about the way he was treated, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about the various issues, and that the officers who had visited him spoke to him about these concerns, and suggested that they would address them, but they did not record these problems.
Chilling Revelations have written to the Singaporeans no problems scoring '-LRB- after they discussed the concerns - RRB-, and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them, chaps, Manning said.
Judge Colonel Denise Lind was also asked why he had not complained about the treatment of his person in January 2011 in a meeting with a panel assessing the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in the form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during this meeting it was his intention to achieve a reduction in the groin injury prevention spree '.
The military said that this restrictive regime - LRB- one level under the supervision regime because of suicide-RRB- used for its protection and safety of others.
Sincerely, I wanted the guards in custody to know I was fine and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life, as I saw it, the defender said Manning.
Manning on Thursday testified about his arrest in Iraq and transport to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transported to a detention center at the Naval Base in Quantico, Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait, and one day he fainted because of the heat.
He said the fact that he was not allowed to know what to do with him and what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
Footage critic My world contracted only to the base of Arifjun, on that cage, the kangaroo said on Thursday, Manning.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning said that, upon arrival at Quantica, he spent most of the days -LRB- at least 21 hours, but often longer than the 23-hour-RRB- in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was allowed only one mattress, a blanket, some clothes, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just being left was against regulations during the day.
Manning said he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned on the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint about the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was relegated to a military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the charges he had raised in Thursday's testimony, concerning that after he was forced to sleep one night in his cell at Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other inmates at the morning count.
Manning testified that at the count he was not allowed to cover his blanket.
In Friday's interrogation, Judge Manning said that, by order of his guards, he had assumed that he had a blanket to cover, but he admitted that no one had given him the order to postpone it.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night because he attempted to show the officer he was not dangerous.
Manning said the officer said he could use a seatbelt from his underwear or his mouthpiece to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning testified that his underwear was removed from his cell that night, his pants and his glasses.
His attorney hopes the judge will take into account his experience over the course of his imprisonment and that in the case of his conviction before a military court, the start of which is expected at the start of next year will greatly reduce his sentence.
The defense said it planned for Manning to plead guilty to lesser crimes and that he would fight against other charges because they were too extreme.
The start of the hearing is scheduled for this week, and the military prosecutor is expected to defend the detention conditions as justified.
The Pentagon said the statement that Manning was being held in line with regulations regarding all arrests held in custody with maximum security.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, unlawful inflicting the publication of intelligence documents on the Internet, transmitting information relating to national security and theft of public property or records.
If charged on all counts, he could be sentenced to life.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of options there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they are reminiscent of hard times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On the last trip to Mexico's capital, I barely broke through the crowd and arrived in the area for an immigrant's agenda where I encountered a problem.
Darts pointed to one of two queues: One for Singaporean Mexicanos wannabes' -LRB-
I stood there for a few seconds and didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and my whole life, I was called a Singaporean Mexican kangaroo.
It's an ethnic acronym, the same as when my friends in Boston are called the Singaporean Ira kangaroo 'and my friends in New York themselves refer to themselves as a Singaporean Italian hooker'.
So, later, I ended up in the name of a homemade Mexican American hooker.
But this was Mexico.
And there was no need to use shortcuts in my grandfather's home.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don't have a vocabulary of native speakers and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood up to the queue for Singaporean Extranjeros giveaways.
I was thinking about the moment this week the newly elected Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited President Obama at the White House.
On the programme, they had the usual matters to discuss when the leaders of these two countries meet: Immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans will stay in Mexico as they travel to the United States.
It wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against drug cartels, though he gave no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader under the threat of weapons to rewrite half of Mexico's territory into the United States.
But for Mexicans who think for centuries, not minutes, the comments are pervasive.
So a minute after the U.S. official says something just a little critical of Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press, and among the elite complaints about how Americans intervene in their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma march on the warpath.
And yet for Mexico, the real challenge is the relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, the people that the country offers options, and others that don't.
The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that in a point of our family tree was a person, perhaps a parent or a grandparents who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person matched the profile - dark skin, weak education, origins from a poor village of atd.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we now live the American dream, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not the Mexican.
Our identity can sometimes be vague, but our loyalty is not.
He is against the United States.
And beyond that, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat, and they view us as an inferior race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.
Our existence is, in their opinion, only a failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they would never have left it.
And we would not find ourselves trapped behind a silk curtain, with good life in the United States, but still lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and in childhood legally traveled to the United States, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans more understand who they are, and Mexican Americans resent that.
Even though she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And, at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know do not feel like part of either.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don't have roots in one.
Mexico is looking at us as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And to make relations even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I learned in my trip, reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as a Singaporean interim embassy critic 'and imagined Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American compatriots how great it is to visit this country, and push for political leaders to consolidate relations with Mexico.
Well.
That's not going to happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And, thanks to inequality of income and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not certain that it is a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States, as they did with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel serene for the way it has been dealt with by their family members in significantly closer past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more glamorous Mexicans twirl 'than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that each such action is futile.
Among the usual unnecessary rumours of who started it, many buildings were turned into debris, killed by more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis, and for the first time, they captured rockets from Gaza in the vicinity of Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even if Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has changed the old ways and Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught up in the nascent chaos in the region.
It may cause their fight to be even bloodier than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that this may interrupt their deadly stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there seems to be no reason for optimism at the moment.
Even if the cease-fire closed on 21 November, the fighting this week would have boosted hawks on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamic movement that has ruled in Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to retreat, even as Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million Gaza residents in one of the world's most pathetic and populous regions, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine that is currently managed by its ardent rivals of Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well find that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world have gained more influence, so Hamas has gained powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, the resurrected regional power that once was Israel's closest Muslim ally, has been joined by Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The cheering people of Hamas say that the Islamic half-moon is obeying around Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where the party is ruled by the party's venom @ militias Hezbollah, despite Syria, where rebels, who are increasingly inclined to Islamabad, may be ousted by Bashar al-Assad, until after Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
Above all, Israel's southern flank has changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Mohamed Morsi's leadership in Egypt, by far the most populous and pivotal Arab country, a balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a player who cannot be ruled out by Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israeli hardliners reach the opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas was put back in the box.
Israel's anti-missile system Iron dome proved its worth, and many Hamas rockets were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unwavering as ever, and many European countries also blamed Hamas for the start of the latest round of violence.
And, most importantly, Israel has thrived, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Even though the Gaza rockets have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, there has been relatively calm from suicide bombings in Israel, partly due to a wall hitting the West Bank, the main part of what may someday be a Palestinian state, and protect Jewish settlements that are still growing despite its unlawfulness from international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party joined an even more radical group headed by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the campaign on January 22, is in a good position.
Why spoil those treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, they would not fire rockets like they did their countrymen in Gaza?
It'll be better if we keep them behind that wall and pinch them when they stick their heads out.
Perhaps hardliners will win, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
Though Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not like Israel too much, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defence spending is higher than the spending of all its four Arab neighbors combined.
Launching a new war with a local superpower will hardly help new Arab governments to heal their economies.
The fact that President Morsi collaborated with President Barack Obama to strike a cease-fire is a good sign, and it may be the beginning of something new.
Israelis, too, should look at the situation in the long term.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, the denial of Palestinians "rights to self-determination is a barrel of gunpowder that must erupt one day in areas occupied by Israel - just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Already, the repression is weakening in the Jewish state of democracy, and demographics are exacerbating the situation as the Arab population grows.
Bloody failures against Gaza conceding every few years to push Hamas will increasingly choose a diplomatic tax.
Both parties need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what voices reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world, and this newspaper: Two states where Israel will advance territory on the grounds of security.
In the short term, there is some hope that a cease-fire will provide a little more influence on the outside of the outside.
Egypt, which together with Turkey and Qatar must strike to stop arms supplies to Gaza, has a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
Arabs also have to push for a match between Hamas and Fatah.
This would make more than an imminent supply of virtual state sovereignty at the UN to the creation of a Palestinian state.
President Obama also has his share of how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term, he neglected to show his own peace plan.
Now, back at the White House, he seems equally reluctant in his entry into the process.
This is woefully short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, laws on nasty cigarette packaging have come into force
In the wake-up green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, there are a warning for smokers and sick parts of the body.
The Australian laws on the ugly packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, have entered into force, and the logos and colours of the brands have replaced the general olive-green boxes with vile images of sick parts of the body, and depictions of children and newborns sickened as a result of the smoking of their parents.
In addition to various health warnings and pictures, they are mandatory from Saturday the only difference between cartons of brand names printed in the same small print.
This is the most stringent regime in the world regarding the packaging of tobacco.
The Australian Federal Government says the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by depriving the offending of its attraction.
It relies on studies that show that if people don't start smoking by the age of 26, there's a 99% chance they won't start smoking ever.
Explaining the venom to very small children, you can see that it understands the message that the tobacco companies are trying to sell to them together with their product, the subpoena says federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, and cites studies that, for example, have shown that children combine the crown in a log with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry has been lobbying hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies have argued that this bill will increase trading on the black market, which will lead to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
Reward scoring Thanks to this legislation, there will be serious unintentional consequences, texting 'says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring in much more of these products to be sold on Australian streets.
Another says the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarette packaging from the silicone used to cover up the disgusting boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Colombian Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeal regarding the laws to the Australian Supreme Court, increased from near-zero sales.
Ha said Zico sold nearly 6,000 pieces of wholesale sales and expects new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible glitch, experts cite the popularity of social media at the demographic group that the plan focuses on.
Throughout a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising, sponsorship of sporting events and demanding that most retailers hide cigarettes from direct sight, tobacco marketing has shifted onstage.
Australia has banned internet advertising carried out by local companies and internet sites, but it cannot restrict foreign websites.
Sneak peek If you're a marketing worker in the tobacco industry, and you only have this little room to promote your products, there's an insurmountable space in which you want to be, Singaporeans says Becky Freeman, a research study in public health at the University of Sydney.
Ms Freeman has noted an increase in ratings on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by Singaporeans in the average Honda franchise.
We have to ask, is he just a private citizen who really loves cigarettes Marlboro and has given the job and created this video, or is he involved in a marketing company?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry has focused on getting loaded with new regulations rather than marketing.
The sector has gone so far as to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for challenging the new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization claim that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia significantly trades.
A decision by the SOO is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has been conducting talks with other governments considering similar laws on packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photos in 2001.
It has now spread to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India are thinking about stricter laws.
Many smokers in Australia are defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
Sneak peek Just pull out a cigarette and stick the box back, texting 'Victor El Hage while buying a box with a photo of a tumour in his mouth.
Frankly, there's only one reason for me to stop smoking, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, who owns the travails of King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, says that thanks to single boxes, it's harder for him to match them to the shelves.
Stripping the load of lifting the load took me one hour, now it takes me four hours, Singaporeans said Yu.
Explaining the Government would simply ban them, then we would say: "OK, that's the end, we close the shop," the kangaroo said, and threw up his hands.
In the world of constant connection, it's not so bad to be bored
Last Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So we had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for another flight is pretty annoying, despite the distraction of books, magazines and iPads -LRB- not to mention the hollow-free shops of -RRB-.
But some scientists and child-development experts are increasingly coming with a flurry of boredom.
They say that for us -LRB- and our children - RRB- is good to be bored sometimes.
It makes the brain go into interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And given that most of us are constantly connected to some screen at this time, we don't have a chance to enjoy the boredom.
So should we support boredom?
Yes, sir.
And no.
But I'll get back to that.
First, as many people have assumed, boredom is a relatively new phenomenon that has occurred with the advent of more leisure.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University in Calgary, who is the author of Boredom: A Lively History -LRB- Historie of the boredom -RRB- -LRB- Yale University Press, 2011 -RRB-.
Chilling VERDICT Actually has a bore of a long history, Singaporeans said.
There was a Latin inscription on the walls in Pompeii, coming from the first century of our year.
And then there's also the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario in Canada.
After viewing the research literature and showing the thoughts of the target group of about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the boredom as the experience of scoring a prank, I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't capable of scoring '.
Boredom is different from apathy, because the person is not involved, but she wants to be.
She says there's no urge to do something about apathy.
She says that at the core of boredom is the glamorous distraction of the process of attention, coupled with a bad mood and a sense of slowly passing time.
Boredom can be a lot to remind you of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a mutual relationship, they have nuanced people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In her study, starring The Undisturbed Mind: A Boredom in Terms of Attention Photographer, which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to the tape to which the person read the article from the magazine.
Some of the groups heard a loud and unrelated TV programme in the next room, others heard so quietly that they barely noticed it, while a third group didn't hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV programme quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but they weren't sure why and attributed these problems to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or instructive task, a distraction can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do something boring, scoring a scam like finding bad parts on a factory line, the distracting music can help you not get bored.
In fact, he said, we now know that the twist and doodle, which is often viewed as a sign of boredom, can actually help with the boredom to fight and keep people physically more attentive.
Pioneering research shows that children who are allowed to drill will learn more and retain more information than those forced to sit in peace, critic 'said Professor Fenske.
We've all been bored sometimes - the delay of my flight, the humming speaker, a particularly lengthy film.
But some individuals have a greater chance of being bored than others.
To help with the measurement of boredom, scientists in the 1980s have developed a homemade Stuppet for susceptibility to nuzzling the left' -LRB- Boredom Proneness Scale-RRB-.
The scale includes questions such as: Stripping the Many things I have to do is repeat, and it's monotonous, bland and I've got so many interests that I don't have time to do all of them.
Using these degrees, scientists have found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular, in terms of the need to have more and different external stimulation.
Teenagers, however, are generally unfazed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor for human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which seven to eight times a day contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents.
He found that 32 per cent of teens said they were bored at school and while doing homework, while 23 per cent said they were bored when they weren't in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentage of boredom was now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said he knows that Singaporean adolescence is the peak time for boredom scoring, which is largely due to the fact that children and youth are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: Workout quiz Is it boring for you?
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to undergo absurd physical risks, play gambling or abuse addiction as a way to alleviate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
Pioneering Nuda is a way of the brain to tell you that you should do something else, hooker 'said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the best thing you should do.
If you're bored and use this energy to play guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy just for a moment, not in the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored, but he won't learn how to entertain himself or self-manage, Professor Fenske said.
And Singaporeans this separate procedure is transmitted from one situation to the other, Singaporean said.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain itself, but will gain greater self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of her.
Rather, our aim should be to feel comfortable when we are out of touch with the constant crushing of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
Sneak peek accuses her of the need to be bored with even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful, Singaporean said.
What people are really looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy free time.
Sneak peek In the environment in which we are constantly re-resourced, texting 'said, scoring spree is hard to find ways to amuse yourself when the noise turns off.
In Colorado, there's no manual on the new marijuana law
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a student at a senior vocational school and a football player in southeast Colorado, is facing felony charges for something that will be legal soon throughout the state - for possession of several grams of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke.
Mr Orozco said one September day he drove with several friends in Lamar, on the plains near the border with Kansas, when he was stopped.
After the officer found marijuana in the car, Mr Orozco was issued a summons for possession of drugs and equipment for drug use - minor offences in which he was fined $100 - and a trial date was set for him.
Villagers apologised to us as criminals, paramedics said Mr Orozco said.
But is he a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote to legalise a small amount of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of minor drug cases depends on the spot rather than on the right.
Hundreds of cases of marijuana possession have already been held here, and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures, has been cancelled.
The police department has stopped blaming adults aged 21 and older for holding a small amount that will be legally allowed after the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But the plaintiffs in the more conservative districts of Colorado have declared that they will continue with existing cases involving marijuana, and still blame people for possession.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver towards the western mountains are voting to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed shops with marijuana in their communities.
Footage critic This issue is evolving so quickly that I don't know what's going to happen next, the defender said by Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.
Heads and regulators in the state of Washington, too.
And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a licensing system for growing, manufacturing, distribution and sale - all until the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, for better or for worse, is ahead of mostly states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now recreational.
Singaporean Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide, Singaporeans said to Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the granting of a licence to sell alcohol to the state of Washington.
But as Mr Smith admitted, no place or system could do more to suggest what might work.
Belief Reveals There is no real precedent that we might be able to follow, Aug. 'he said.
The Washington law, the so-called Ito-502, is taking effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum during which there will still be no state licensing system, but legal possession does.
And there are daunting mechanical issues that must be resolved over the course of this time, such as how to balance a directive of the state regarding the Singaporean equivalent approach of stripping 'licensed marijuana with its ban on trafficking in hemp to 330 metres from schools, parks, children's fields or children's centres.
Reward Photographer Nowhere will be more difficult to place a licensed trade in hemp than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle, hooker 'said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal hemp, a recently-based research group.
On November 21, police chief Oates of the city of Aurora sent his officers an e-mail in which he told them that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute the offences for possession of a small amount of marijuana at every citizen aged over 21 years and that police extortionate with immediate effect the vigilante 'stop blaming people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said police would enforce city laws regulating marijuana growers and that it would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In the Weld district in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck is a tougher look.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute cases of marijuana possession, mostly as a way to push users to seek treatment.
He is currently facing charges of possession of 56 grams or fewer marijuana 119 people, though many of them are facing more charges.
Footage critic Our Office is required to prosecute a criminal offence that was punishable by the time it took place, Mr Buck said in his statement.
The response was complicated even in places such as the rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the city's largest city, no longer blame the adult for possession of a small quantity.
The district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but he also chose not to reject all ongoing cases of possession.
Emotional Reveals I don't think I'm losing my time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes, Singaporeans said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And conflicting reactions across the state have revealed a deep ambivalence among local officials in view of this large state green experiment.
For district prosecutors, this is a foolhardy cultural barrier critic, said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents defendants from marijuana possession, and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of marijuana laws.
Singaporeans have watched such a big part of their lives by prosecuting people that they still can't really accept that it's legal, Singaporeans said.
As the first states to treat a small amount of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best way to become national drug-testing cases for legalizing drugs.
Advocates and state authorities are planning a new frontier for legalized sales, while also anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which still plans to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana for federal crimes.
Advocates of legalizing marijuana are hoping to submit the Justice Department.
Despite several arrests of marijuana shoppers for medical purposes and patients using it that drew attention, it left a mostly federal government business with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and another 16 states in operation.
While drug agents are unlikely to leave the door to pick up a small bag of drugs, it is likely to resist allowing state-regulated deals with recreational marijuana-enabled new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser in the field of anti-drug policy administration to President Obama.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for the federal authorities.
Before the election day, some local governments approved the moratorium on any new business with marijuana, although it will last for about a year before any trade can be opened.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the state's west has proposed a half-year ban and is likely to come into force next week.
Sneak peek We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where we're going to give someone a license and then we're going to have a big federal issue, hooker 'said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We are looking at what the community voted for, as opposed to what has been voted down by the state.
There are really many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: Glamorous Reveals I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a conservationist.
Only today's university students are not challenged for their views.
I don't remember ever dreaming of studying at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world's largest seat of knowledge, a modern-minded Greek symposium motivated by the two pillars of civilization, free thought, and tolerance.
And so far, at the end of the 1980s, within two weeks of taking on Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I packed my bags and I rushed into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed I had given up because I had objected to making love to students in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson flatly declared that I left because I was forced to drink from battered pots.
The truth was less comic.
I escaped.
Yes, I ran away because I was the subject of systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of perceived enlightenment, it was both bigoted and barbaric: My father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a senior adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I am a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You can ask why I'm pulling it out now.
It is simply because recent reports suggest that a new generation of students to the right of Wednesday suffer from similar pursuits.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week, a group of these students sought the same protection of equal rights as gay people, people with disabilities, and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the younger rockers - LRB- jcr-RRB- at Corpus Christi College claim that, because of their political views, Singaporeans are often actively isolated, exhibiting personal attacks and being told they are not welcome indoors.
They are asking for a position in the university's equal opportunity committee to ensure they can freely communicate their views.
Their situation was not helped by the recent documentary on BBC Two called Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right-LRB- Cup country: Young, intelligent and right-wing -RRB- about student political affairs, which conservatives described as weirdos and neo-Nazis.
In the show, he was presented by graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association -LRB- the conservative Association of Oxford University - OUCA -RRB-, who rode Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a stick with a silver head.
At other high schools, conservative students say he is with them because of the introduction of higher tuition fees as with homemade scapegoats.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of Nottingham University Conservative Association -LRB- Conservative Association of Nottingham University -RRB-, told Sunday newspaper that Singaporeans left-wing influence on campus is growing.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without meeting us at all.
A 21-year-old student of history at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the move for more protection, says such a climate is a homemade troublesome prank, while 19-year-old elected President OUCA Stephanie Cherill says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of members of the jcr to people on the right of Wednesday.
Chilling Reveals That poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as for the good living conditions of members, Singaporeans says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority about one member.
I joined in September of 1986, an 18-year-old and a crippling way of shyness.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was the most feverish.
A year earlier, the university voted to refuse to award an honorary title to former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in funding for higher education.
From the atmosphere, the Stalinists would be trembling with concern.
Within the first few days of the opening week, when new students miss each other and with the professors, I got a taste of the pelt that was to come.
I have found that not only do professors in silence approve of picking up conservative pupils, but they are also taking part in it.
A policy of horrendous strikes, privatization and opposition from the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa have been brought into the wood-panelled auditorium.
My first lecture was about the translation of the French text from the 18th century to English, and what followed was not ready.

It was pretty stiff.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like cake dough, was a lot of bile.
Singaporeans Thatcherites refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?
The other students giggled.
There were tears in my eyes.
Sneak peek I suggest you take some basic lessons of French in your own time, unless you're too busy with social issues, hooker 'growled Professor Pitt.
I went back to my room.
At dinner at the school, I sat alone when I felt a slight pat on the shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
Sneak peek I know who you are, hooker 'he said graciously.
Unfortunately, that's the case.
Anyone who is suspected of conservatism is the target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to get worse for you.
Most conservative pranks pretend to be Labour.
Later in the local pub, I chickened out to pretend.
I insisted I disagree with everything that Thatcher said.
This trick proved unsuccessful.
Student of the first year of the field of philosophy, politics and economics that -LRB- what irony-RRB- went to Eton, he said: Congrats You're the daughter of a fascist pig.

Verdict Reveals How are the Conservatives Love? The Stranger 'asked one.
He's hitting each other, right?
I felt the way they had to feel gay before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people just after dark?
Would I have to change in Labour and suppress my natural streak?
Three years have developed before me as a purgatory of ignoring and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who resided at my college.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being an adviser to Margaret Thatcher for foreign policy and one of those writing her speeches.
He was almost there.
He hated the place for his guilt and pettiness, and for his tendency toward a Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he joined the professor at Bilkent University in Turkish Ankara.
Sneak peek You're not going to be happy here, hooker 'he told me.
I began commuting from Oxford to my parents' house in London, seeking refuge with my detached metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
Throughout his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
Adorable VERDICT But it's the best place in the world, Singaporeans said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of a dream mood.
Even my communist friends always had perfect ways.
His moistened eyes laughed.
Try again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience got worse.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week, in the course of teaching, when another professor of history in utter respectability stated that I was a Singaporean enemy of the people's lyrics, I decided to do the same.
Even though I was inside the red ribbon, I admitted to being homesick by my parents brainwashed 'and I called them tearful old footy chaps'.
Relief was just short-term.
A nail in the coffin of my Oxford career has been arrested by my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch newspaper each week.
My door was locked.
I crouched inside, and after five minutes my pursuers gave it up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and grabbed the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a sleazy weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subjected to such intimidation and venom in the education institution.
What is more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, not only to the 14 conservative prime ministers, but which also today hides behind an undeserved reputation as a place of equality and freedom of thought.
Adorable critic Valentino likes an elegance rather than the glory of woman'
On the occasion of the exhibition starring Valentino: The master fashion-making critic, who was launched this week in London, spoke to ABC with Naty Abascalová, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabela I. English, is the only place in the British capital to host the Valentina Garavani exhibition.
The designer has confirmed this at the launch of a celebratory retrospective starring Valentino: A master of fashion-making photography, which represents more than 130 models of the top fashion created by his studio over the past 50 years.

This exhibition is the conclusion of the story, in which he is apologising to Signor comedian 'Garavani's only protagonist, but without his caged mare, he could not be written.
Valentino has always felt enchanted by the rare and distant world of the aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which will last until March 3, is full of private correspondence and photos with the signatures of the most important noblemen, from Princess Salims Aga Khan over the Greek Princess Marian-Chantal and Margaret of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exposes these personal memories as trophies of his social upheaval: From a simple tailor-made from the city of Voghera to the north of Italy to the idol of international Singaporeans the bohemian cream of riches.

The toughest craft in the world: Sulphur porters in the area of the Kawah ijen volcano
In four euros, they gamble in the region of the Indonesian volcano with their lives and greetings when they bear 70 pounds of sulphur down the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who are literally working in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who earn a living by conquering the sulphur from the Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this, every day must be flogged to the bottom of the crater, where sizzling gases from inside the Earth and in contact with the air pass into a solid state.
After sitting out large blocks of sulfur, which together weighs up to 70 pounds, he carries them on the shoulders in two bamboo baskets along steep stone paths.
At the top of the volcano, which stands at 2 386 meters, it's only 250 metres, but exhausted carriers take over 40 minutes to climb the tortoise pace up, because they maintain the balance and carefully consider their steps so they don't slip and fall into the abyss.
They know that any stumbling block could cost them their lives as it happened to a French tourist who crashed off the rocks of Kawah ijen years ago.
Miners in Kawah ijust earn five cents for every kilo of sulphur they extract
When they're up, they're hitting the road around the tourists, who are photographing them as if they were monkeys in the circus, and they wearily take the heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company placed on something below, at an altitude of 1850 metres.
This is the PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has benefited in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees -LRB- five cents -RRB- per kilo of sulphur.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupees -LRB- 83 cents -RRB- petrochemical industry, as this nerve has its place in everyday life and is used to produce matches, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whittle sugar.
Adorable flick Because it's commonly worn 70 pounds, we make about 46,000 rupees -LRB- 3.8 euros -RRB- for each trip, scoring 'explains to us Anto, who usually takes three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and he's devastated at the end, but he can earn 138 000 rupees -LRB- 11.5 euros -RRB- per day.
Even if it appears to be a negligible amount for such inhumane efforts, it is three times what he would earn in the field.
Explaining the daily wage of miners is very high here, for example, for collecting coffee, paying 15,000 rupees - LRB- 1.2 euros -RRB- per day, and the salary in a fortnight is two million rupees -LRB- 167 euros -RRB-, Aug. 'explains the porter, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees -LRB- 6.2 euros -RRB- per day, and the work was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is as compelling in Indonesia as a sieve: Singaporeans I married with a young girl in Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to the Java to convert to Islam.
Anto has asthma, he's got a bad breath, still coughing, and his eyes are irritable with toxic gases.
In his 27 years Anto, three times a day, is risking his life in the Kawah volcano, whose sulfur has already begun to take its toll on him, even though his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's still coughing, and his eyes are irritable with toxic gases that leak out of the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
I'm going to work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French, scoring 'promises more than obscene English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young person stifled by fate could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist at the hotel, and instead does the work of a carrier.
She shares a dirty wooden shack with other porters and gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulphur doesn't stop hanging out at night, and its distinctive yellow colour changes in blue and September in the dark.
Even through the surrounding darkness, he fades Anto into the crater, illuminating the path of a small lamp that he had attached to his helmet and had bought it himself for his own money.
About 400 carriers carry baskets from the bottom of the crater on their shoulders
Although the company has high incomes, sulphur extraction has not been mechanised for cost savings, nor does it provide the carriers working on their own and with such efforts, no equipment.
In fact, they don't even get a share of the 30,000 rupees of -LRB- 2.5 euros -RRB- from a bonus for photography, which along with a ticket for 15,000 rupees -LRB- 1.2 euros -RRB- selecting a natural park watchdog from tourists arriving to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
Chilling VERDICT This work is for cattle, and not for people, Singaporeans contend Madrusin, a burly 42-year-old carrier who has worked in Kawah for three decades, has since left school.
He manages to lift up to 110 pounds and assures us that he will last work, scoring a workout as long as he can, because he needs the money to educate his three sons at the age of 18 and 10 years old.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulphur burns the throat and pinch in the eyes, when the wind unexpectedly turns and traps the miners in the thick fumes coming out of the volcano, the miners are so claiming that no one is complaining that they suffer from serious illnesses, but it is obvious from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, knees, and wounds on the shoulders caused by the weight of the baskets.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can pick up just 50 pounds in his 53 years.
Each day, both he and his colleagues are holed up in a volcano of 15 tonnes of sulphur, which then three lorries braved the steep road between the Houses to a warehouse in Tamansari a remote 18 kilometres away.
Singaporeans I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life, scoring 'declares Unainik and opening a wide mouth in which there are a few teeth missing.
Of his five sons, the eldest, a 30-year-old, also earns a dollop of sulphur.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the world's toughest crafts persists from generation to generation - crafts that perform human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore sheds babies to save economy
Singapore is blamed for not having children, on a career, stress and cost of living and education.
Singaporean Occupation of Singapore needs to grow.
I'm married, and I'm a patriot, you're my wife, and you're a patriot.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of the advertisement for menthol mints, but nonetheless - or maybe it's just that - the video in early this year in Singapore has spread to YouTube.
These sentences are part of a rap that uses local hints of the type of homemade squid to put the buns in the oven like a mockery of the rate of birth rate in Singapore.
The BBH advertising agency, which created the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a funny way.
Artistic director of the agency, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the influence of music to make people meet the giveaway of their civic duty of scoring.
Adorable prank One is exclusively on the Internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt it was a subject we need to touch.
We knew the government was trying to do a lot of things like expanding the perfumes with pheromones or organizing the dating parties.
Many of these ideas could be creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought, why not make the most creative possible thing, such as the composition of the rapt, to solve this problem.
1.2 children
Whoever doesn't take it very lightly is the Singapore government.
They spend £1,300 each year to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriage and a family provides up to £15,000 per child, extending maternity leave and allocating financial benefits.
But all these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a rich city-state with advanced technology in southeast Asia, also known to conservatism of its officials and strict social controls.
The fertility rate in Singapore with respect to the layoffs of the population is currently 1.2 child per woman.
The last time it exceeded the fertility rate was 2, which is considered a recovery rate, in 1976.
Why don't Singapore have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, the director of the marriage and family of the National Bureau of Statistics says it's because of the giveaways for a better education of Singaporeans' and giveaways a wider range of career opportunities giveaways.
Fewer defender People thus have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, it's not just a wedding and family, texting 'explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and the postponement of marriage and child exploitation. The result is a reduction in fertility rates in Singapore.
While there were efforts in immigration policy to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against a decline in population, it has caused resentment among locals.
On some Singapore websites, it is seen openly xenophobic against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are criticised for maintaining low salaries and a small effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the governing party of Singapore registered its worst election result since independence last year.
After the election, there was an attempt to tackle the problem through quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in fertility rates has a familiar impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending, and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences for Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate business.
The city's development office has begun to regulate the number of small apartments known as homemade homemade boxes from the shoes kangaroo that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square metres and have had great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these flats can promote a bachelor's lifestyle and discourage developers to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, the CEO of the developer company EL Developers, says their homemade homemade boxes from the shoes kangaroo are selling far more quickly than larger houses.
Workout Auctions Are more popular, by selling for days to weeks faster than homes with more size.
That's why they're much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously capped when they wanted to offer too many small homes in one project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could lead to an increase in the birth rate of the nation, the conversation with Singapore working in a financial district in the city centre suggests that they will not have a big effect.
Singaporeans People are still in stress, the houses are expensive, as well as education, so many people are postponing it, texting 'says a young official.
Wearers Other have children.
But for me, it's important to rely on your own money and time, scoring a different, about 20-year-old, a young man.
Men and women mention careers, stress and cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them having children.
So whatever the government is trying to force in order to have children, it is eventually Singapore who have the last word on the establishment of the family.
What is private offline is private and online
Privacy.
According to the dictionary issued by the Royal Spanish Academies, this is something that has a personal nature or a foolhardy area of private life that every right has a right to protect against any disruption to the defender '.
What is privacy for a younger 16-year-old?
How do you apply this definition in your everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the danger he is exposed to when he publishes matters on the Internet that he would certainly not tell anyone in routine communication?
Journalists from the ElPeriódico have interviewed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years old who are frequent internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to cater to something completely self-evident in a personal level and for a Singaporean user's name and password kangaroo, if they were social networks.
Footage critic has the biggest secret I would not disclose, texting, saying 10-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
Glamorous photography They're a very secret secret, my mum can know about them, but not the whole world, Singaporeans claim.
Texting kangaroos On FB I give pretty pictures or pictures of how we play.
I'm also talking to acquaintances.
I wouldn't share a picture that wasn't mine, or a picture that would ridicule anyone, the kangaroo says.
This boy realizes that it's wrong to publish obscene photographs, photos of nude people or photographs of crimes, or write degrading or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine supporters on Twitter.
Most are related.
There is also a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
Sneak peek I've allocated an account on Twitter so I can express my views and write interesting contributions.
I don't know if anyone is going to answer me, I'm just giving them, texting 'adds up.
Glamorous Reveals Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far or fast communicating with friends, texting 'says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone had recommended someone unknown to him.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager owns accounts on the networks Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and at the last mentioned network admits he doesn't know 20 people from his list of friends.
Chilling quiz I don't worry about it because we have something in common, such as the music, the kangaroo says.
According to this boy, none of them showed him, nor did he want the address or number of the phone.
Chilling Reveals If they pressed or demanded it from me, I would simply remove them from my account, the defender admits.
Jose volunteered for Ask after he read the recommendation on Twitter.
This boy is no stranger to what is now called cybercrime -LRB- cyberbullying -RRB-.
Singaporeans have been blackmailed by my friends on the social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never knew who he was, vindicated.
The victim was not checked out of the account, according to Jose.
Sneak peek Just activated the private mode.
Then he explains a series of steps to secure the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would have published pictures of known in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.

Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate of the College of Education and teaching, believes that in order for children and adolescents to be well-oriented in social networks, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform them.
It states that: Stripping the Internet has emerged as a means of seeking information, but when social networks have emerged, the rules of the game have changed.
Marrielos Porrasa notes that academic worker Marc Prensky, a graduate student at Yale, and the author of Article Digital natives and digital immigrants, has introduced these concepts to explain the phenomenon.
Singaporeans Digital natives are children and young people born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and yet we are learning ourselves, Singaporeans says.
He explains that this is a complex subject, ludicrous because we ask them to discern what it is appropriate to spread, to publish and to say, and what on the contrary is not, in an age when they are not yet ripe for it.
Also, to be - as far as the surroundings - are concerned, at a time when what they most desire is to be popular, have thousands of friends and not think about the consequences of the scam, he adds.
According to this specialist, it is the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is, asking questions that makes them think.
Texting vows to tell them not to do something, it doesn't work, texting 'adds.
Further, Marrielos Porras lists some of the options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like someone to publish your picture the way you published a friend's story?
Do you know what else they publish about you?
When you call people in pictures from the celebrations, did you ask these people for permission?
And one more: Do they still need to know what you're doing?
Another point is to realise that they have to behave in the internet environment in the same way as out of it.
It's the same rules.
Sneak peek Man is governed by respect, morals and other principles outside the internet, and the same should be on social networks, Singaporeans claim.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, teacher at first grade and education adviser explains that it is essential for parents of children to carefully read the social networking rules.
Verdict Reveals If he understands every idiocy, they have a good basis to talk to the children about the consequences that setting up an account on the internet can have.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to share or publish, Singaporeans says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of homesickness don't talk to strangers.
The Summit of South America ends and the Declaration of Lima has not been published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations -LRB- Unasur-RRB- ended in Peru today ended without a statement from Limy, which was envisioned and which was reportedly signed by seven present presidents.
Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of heads of state and government by Unasur, but representatives from the State Department and the presidential office, who set out to publish the document at the end of the summit, said it would later be published on the Peruvian government's website.
They also said the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several short press statements.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the negotiations, a video of the presidential gathering was carried out in the press room without sound with a message transcript of the confidential session, the transmission of the audio prevented from scoring.
A small amount of information held by journalists was provided by press speakers of some of the government who were present, but not a Peruvian spokesman.
The only document published during the negotiations was a list of participating presidents, which gave rise to hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
She later circulated the Peruvian presidential office to the media e-mail with a transcript of the Final Declaration of Delegates' summit, but it is only a statement from President Humala, and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted a third summit of the South American and Arab countries - LRB- América del Sur- Países Árabes, ASPA -RRB - and, on this occasion, the promised declaration from Limy was not yet published, although it was eagerly required by the press.
It can be found on the official website of ASPA that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure broadcasting for all journalists, but completely prevented the flow of information.
The summit ended, among other things, by the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt the judgment of the Hague Court, which addresses the dispute over the border between the two countries.
President of Peru Ollanta Humala and President Chile Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting, confirming that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which begins with a hearing on Monday to discuss the dispute that launched Lima against Santiago.
Blasphemy, we will make a judgment that will resolve the dispute, which we are discussing today in this international court, the defender said President Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
Singaporean Chile has been, is, and will be a country respecting international law, peaceful resolution of disputes, conventions and international courts, the defender has supplied Piñera and greeted President Humala with a grip on the flags of the two countries.
Confirmation of the two presidents being subjected to a decision by the International Court of Justice was published after Colombia adopted the Bogota Pact this week, giving it a submission to the courts of the international court, who ruled on the maritime border with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered this decision wholly flawed.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil-LRB- Dilma Rouseff-RRB-, Venezuela-LRB- Hugo Chávez -RRB-, Bolivia-LRB- Evo Morales - RRB- and Argentina-LRB- Cristina Kirchner - RRB-.
Paraguay was excluded from the Unasur organization in 2011 after the appeal of then-President Fernando Luga and the meeting did not participate.
Host President Ollanta Humala was commissioned to launch early speeches and end the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read the final document, in which he informed that 16 agreements had been taken and had been scheduled to work on 31 projects between South American countries, with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, the UNASUR member states will take the important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, which is because of which the "stay-at-home" agreements are broadened.
He urged action to improve favouritism cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organised crime, to better the availability of medicines and the cheap internet in all parts of South America and to a joint and effective measure against the risks of natural disasters.
When Europe is in crisis, Singaporeans do not have the economic consolidation - LRB- of Latin America - RRB- winning the essence, but it is to serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future, the defender added Humala.
Singaporeans have decided to prioritise a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport links of the various locations of South America, especially rural and border areas... to make our countries better connected and create new economic ties, the defender said in a read speech by the Peruvian president.
He mentioned that five of those projects involved Peru and the transverse axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two are related to better links with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
Sincerely, we hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its return to the Union of the South American Nations defender, from which she is currently excluded.
Another of the issues raised by the summit was needed for Latin America to remain a thriving and peaceful area that is complete and has good neighbourly relations.
In that sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his attendance at a regional meeting that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, in Mexico on Saturday, to treat the International Court's judgment regarding a dispute over the maritime border that is disputed by Bogota.
Explaining Climbs It's possible that tomorrow -LRB- on Saturday - RRB- meeting with President Daniel Ortega, hooker 'said Santos.
Singaporeans discuss all the solutions, none are excluded, nor the treaty with Nicaragua, which would require negotiations with this country, the broadcaster pointed out.
Sincerely, I hope to be able to tell President Ortega to conduct the negotiations as civilized as possible, and the most considerate possible form, "Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they are to attend the inauguration of that President Enrique Peñi Niety.
As part of the summit, EU defence ministers have tentatively met to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the area.
The members of the UNASUR organisation are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname, and Paraguay, although the last one is currently excluded.
Peru is a temporary chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a joint citizenship is a target in which Singaporeans with South America, in this case, really, have to learn from Europe Singaporeans'.
Correa, who was attending the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations -LRB- Unasur-RRB- in Lima, declared on state-run TV the Perú that Europeans have apologised for killing in the Second World War Crimes' and in other conflicts, Singaporeans, but now they are virtually one of the fathers.'
In this sense, he defended the creation of a South American citizenship that members of Unasur support.
Internally, it is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country, which is already among the members of the Andean community, but there are still reactionary areas that want to return us to the past, the subpoena pointed out.
The Ecuadorian president has said, among other things, that he agrees to reunite the Organization of American States-LRB- OAS-RRB- under the condition that the influence of Anglo-Saxon states is reduced, and those who signed the San Jose Convention on Human Rights are to be reduced.
In the lead-up, those in the lead are never committed to anything, and we South Americans, on the other hand, will sign everything.
It is inconceivable that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is being funded in Washington by the United States, the defender said in a reference to the political asylum provided by Ecuador's founder WikiLeaks Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, and respected his vindication of deep democratic values and human rights activists.
It said that at the time, the Singaporean existed there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be extradited to a third country, regardless of the ongoing remediation process.
In addition, he criticized the Swedish justices, who asked him to be interviewed in the Swedish territory for alleged sex offences, with Singaporeans owning their own Swedish legislation to carry out an interview with a video conference call that could take place from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
Correa said there was a risk that physical and psychological health would be exacerbated at Assange.
Chilling Reveals I have not spoken to him since he is at our embassy, but the ambassador has informed me that he has minor lung problems, but nothing serious, a critic 'said the Ecuadorian head of state.
Surgeon Rescued Hale but that his physical and psychological condition will worsen because he is locked in a small area without the possibility of moving on fresh air.
That would mark the health of everyone, Singaporeans said.
President Correa noted that addressing the asylum provided by Assange from June to the Ecuadorian embassy in London on the basis of a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that with London, talks were held to resolve the imprisonment of WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate on human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but talks have continued.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzon leads the series of proceedings in various European instances, texting him.
He said that giveaways if the UK issues a pass tomorrow, it all ends up scoring.
And if Sweden's Mr Assange hears at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, how it allows its legislation without a problem, and as it has been done in other cases, it will be the end of that problem tomorrow.
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and he explained that he certainly doesn't tolerate favouritism of mediocrity, bad intentions and a lie that undermines the freedom of expression giveaway.
The greatest enemies of the free press are not us, the underlings, and the perverted politicians, but the bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion, and blackmail, "he said.
From this perspective, he expressed joy that neither such journalists, Singaporeans nor bankers, nor the hegemonic countries, nor the bourgeoisie dominate Ecuador's giveaways, and pressured that, if re-elected, Singaporeans would continue to make changes to the right path and in the right direction.
President Correa also backed the decision to further maintain a veto expressed by Paraguay over the EU's membership of Unasur, at least until its next election, and argued that the total of Singaporeans must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and the pushback shrouded in the legality of the giveaway, because, in fact, Singaporeans destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy giveaways.
In addition, the Ecuadorian president said he believes the Singaporeans' wishes for their Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos will negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime border between the two countries now, at the time after the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which ruled in favor of Nicaragua.
At the moment, the judgment is not accepted.
Divergent Reveals This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be assessed wide to overcome and be able to go forward.
He also expressed hope in settling the dispute over the maritime border, which he addresses in the same trial of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that the scoring spree is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries commit to accept judgment, no matter how tough the scoring. "
In the context of the possibility of him running for the next presidential election in Ecuador to go in order for a third mandate, he noted that he perceives this possibility of apologising with great optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes a very difficult giveaway.
Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will leave public life.
Privately, she has never been interested in power, but such an unfair situation, such as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, can only be remedied by political power.
My political movement believes that I am the one who guarantees this likely victory, so we have to accept that responsibility, defender said.
Scoring spree If I have won, it would be my last presidential term and then I would leave politics out of politics.
If we lose, it's the same thing.
I've made up my mind, scoring.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
Critic Vow I have just spoken to Venezuelan vice-president Nicolás Madur, who says that President Chávez has gone on a planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
This is not a relapse in the health of the president, the defender explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian state today attended the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and State of the Union of South American Nations -LRB- Unasur-RRB-, which has been shut down by calls for greater regional integration to maintain development, equality and safety.
Victims of AIDS are today due to late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
Chilling VERDICT It was like a lightning strike to me, the footage 'tells me in the memory of the moment of truth that a doctor tried to cater a little to ease the venom', but apparently without success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take his illness on his own, and began to talk about it, with such dedication that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is, without doubt, one of the most ancient HIV units in the Civic Hospital in Guadalajara-LRB- HCG -RRB-, to which he came in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus - LRB- HIV-RRB- from 22 years, which was something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, neither did the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security -LRB- IMSS -RRB-
Back then, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it's possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are a lot of people who don't know about their disease and come when the virus has caused the destruction of the organism and transmitted the immune system, and they become victims of accidental infections.
The 31-year-old since the world's AIDS outbreak, or at least since the first documented cases, giveaways mean a big success that the life expectancy of a patient, which in time and the appropriate way to start with the treatment, is exactly the same as the healthy people 'venom, "said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV in Civic Hospital in Guadalajara, with that information being confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
An infestation and specialist in HIV-venom @ AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that the scientists had concluded that since 2008 AIDS was not a death sentence, but that survival and full-fledged life depended on the degree of disability in the immune system of patients diagnosed with the disease, and better be on those who do not use drugs: People with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 cells of CD4 to 50 years.
Simply put, it means that whoever is HIV-diagnosed in 25 years can, according to these knowledge, Singaporeans while adhering to treatment live without problems until the 75-year-old, "the doctor explained in the interview.
To highlight this progress, it is worth noting that the average life of Mexicans is now 76 years old.
Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years and, in Mexico's case, the number of people who died from AIDS has fallen from 6 678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011-LRB- yearnings of the joint United Nations program for HIV-venom @ AIDS - UNAIDS - RRB-, it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died from the discovery of AIDS, according to the national statistics.
Only in the state of Jalisco died in 2011 of 255 people, and by this May 187, however, a universal approach to anti-retroviral drugs has been secured since 2005.
- Why do people continue to die from illness?
- The problem is that the problem is not in the way of access to treatment.
That's the way I see it happening at the hospital.
The problem is that patients are coming at a very advanced stage because they do not know the condition of the disease, or at the late stage of the disease.
It adds a compelling figure: Stripping the Nine out of ten patients comes when some associated infections are already shown, the only thing that needs to be done to do more to affect overall mortality is the disease sooner to diagnose, and therefore, on a large scale, they need to offer tests to determine the disease to all those who request a subpoena. "
In his proposal, he coincided with specialists and officials from the State Council for AIDS Prevention in the state of Jalisco, and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who had come to take the tests to a private lab just because his friend had done it, and, despite his low age, had already released AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the usual complications.
Workout workout Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything else.
Workout Auctions If I'm going to die, I'd rather be out three times a week, texting, but that's not my case.
The change was for the better, healthy eating, exercising, taking medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he was suffering from cancer.
Chilling workout I live a normal life like everyone.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I pay attention to myself and the other person, the comedian 'lists Fabrizio, who has accepted the challenge of sharing his experience with the diary of Milenio Jalisco to motivate his testimonies to those who are scared today within the World's AIDS Day.
If they take the risks, let them know as soon as possible, if they're HIV-positive, they're better, and if they've been diagnosed, they can live like anybody else if they're responsible.
This message summarizes the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a large gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalayan journalist who is researching information about the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places that are devoted to this task, they have actually increased the distribution of condoms, they used to give us one or two, today they give us packages and 100 condoms, which is very well, but there are still people who don't have access to the condoms, he said.
Among the most susceptible to new infections are adolescents.
Congrats On What do you want? Texting is a common question full of irony and assessment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy staff and medical staff that adolescents want to avoid, a reporter says.
He designed this ineffectual distribution to change, so that condoms aren't just for pulses, but those hundred are in the dispensary in public toilets, in places where young people often go.
Reward photography Isn't the support of promiscuity.
Nor is it the giveaway to pay the beer and the motel giveaways, as Governor Emilio González responded to the question if he would agree to distribute the Conservatives in his district.
The best is to make condoms available to those who already have sex life, the comedian noted.
Key figures in the state of Jalisco
There were 13 435 cases of -LRB- 12 158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV-RRB-.
This situation means fourth place in Mexico in new and established AIDS cases and 13th place in the context of HIV.
92% of the disease is a sexual path, 6% of the blood route is 2% perinatal.
Some 50,000 people are estimated to live with HIV, for one registered case is four to five people who do not know about the disease.
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals, which does not respect the restructuring of Grupo Vro's debt restructuring in Mexico, raises a vicious precedent for any national enterprise with branches in a neighboring country and a solvency problem.
So it seems that the procedures for restructuring firms that allow for Mexican laws, in a country of stripes and stars, in spite of international agreements, do not apply.
The approval of a judgment issued on 15 June last year by Judge Harlin Halem in the bankruptcy court for northern Texas leaves Mexican companies without defence against the possibility of confiscating their property on the other bank of the River Bravo.
However, the ruling opens the main Mexican manufacturer of glass doors to the Supreme Court of the United States with appeals against three irregularities.
At the outset, it must be said that while the judge of this case claims that creditors are supposed to follow the insolvency law of the United States, the Fifth District Court of Appeals in New Orleans says the main process sets out bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
First, this would point to an ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency by multinationals.
In essence, a United Nations model for unification of the international trade law that arbitral the organization of the American Law Institute has been created for this purpose.
Second, the judgment provides that, without a vote of branches from the internal corporate structure, when it is recognised by the parent company Vitro to the branches, the majority required for approval of the restructuring would not be achieved.
However, they concede this option to the Mexican laws.
The fact is that Vitro's case was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples of Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intra-corporate debts were routed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
In addition, it is true that even after deducting the votes of the branches, the creditors - who oppose Vitro in the United States, that is, funds giveaways to the Singaporeans, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliott Internacional and Liverpool Limited - have not reached a majority.
In the vote, they would achieve about 45 per cent to 37.
That figure is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From another point of view, Vitro is guilty of the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of a serious economic crisis that struck the United States.
In the meantime, the family firm González Sady will lodge an appeal for a new assessment directly to the Court of Appeal for the assessment to take place at full participation, with the participation of five judges, having initially voted only three.
If it fails here, it will demand a review of the process of higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
On the case, it is serious that the court omitted the document sent by the Mexican government as a service amicus curiae, in which Vitro's practice in the insolvency law is described in detail, and in which it points out that the company has been relieved by the fact that it has embraced the agreements signed by the two countries to confront the law with Chapter 15 of the United States "insolvency law.
It refers to the fact that the country underwent the United Nations "principles of the United Nations for international trade, that is the rules for international defaults, which guarantee equality for both debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: Punishment for Vitro and the state.

Héctor Reveals Healing Hetin Reveals' Reyes: Comedian Reveals Basketball Was My Life Information'
Basketball world champion Héctor defender Hetin defender 'Reyes has been linked to this sled sport for more than 60 years and has traveled through it all the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have that many memories of the history of local basketball, as has Héctor defender Hetin Raises' Reyes.
Reyes was before he was caught by a brain stroke on a wheelchair in 2008, dedicated to this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of the younger category, the Player of the National Basketball League BSN, the owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón in the national basketball league, or president of the Portable Basketball Federation.
Singaporeans I have been happy throughout my life in basketball for a lot of roles, including several at the same time as when I was in the 1990s by the president of the National League of BSN, the general manager of the national team and the chairman of the federation, the critic 'recalled Reyes while visiting reporters of the newspaper Primera Mountain at his home in Bayamón, where he has lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
Blasphemy Basketball was my life.
Reyes does not exaggerate in his claims.
The walls of his house, which are almost all adorned with pictures and commemorative items from his long career, testify.
Bayamon in the heart
With the greatest movement of all the clashes, those reminiscent of his tenure at the Vaqueros since the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or owner of the team.
Scoring quiz That has been my best years, I've enjoyed the most, because I've had an opportunity with the team of los Vaqueros since 1967 to participate in eight championships, whether as owner, co-owner, or coach.
It has been a number of successful years, including five championships held in the years from 1971 to 1975.
And then I parted with one champion - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy was deposed in the BSN.
That's when the team took over the defender Cuco starring 'Ortiz, who was an outstanding lead, defender' said Reyes.
Chilling Reveals I remember that Gene Bartow, who was previously a coach here and has been at the Alabama University in Birmingham, told me, I've told you, I've got an upmarket two-metre player for you.
You want him?
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the break-up of Raymond Gausey, who became a member of the team and one of our best shots.
I remember saying that if Mincy brings Bayamon's victory in the Championship, Gausse will then contribute to the next.
The champion, when the Vaqueros team played Gausse, enjoyed, but only remotely, because he had already performed as president of the basketball federation in 1988.
At that time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his functions and enjoy Mincy's location in the national team.
Sneak peek I remember the first time we beat the United States in a qualifier Olympic match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we ended up neighborhoods, but we should have had the Broncos not be the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final toss, the defender said Reyes.
Is the World Cup team in 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one who defeated the Dream Team at the Olympics in 2004.
But my favourite was the national team in the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991 when we won the gold and we blew the United States team that was pretty much the same one that blew us bronze at the World Cup.
The team had not only had Mincy, Gausey, Ramona Rivas, Fica Lopez, and the coolest Piculin hooker '-LRB- Ortiz-LRB-, but also there were the youths-LRB- Javier-RRB- Controversy Toñito hooker' Colón and James Carter, brothers León-LRB- Francisco and Edgar-RRB-, and Mario Lt. Col.
The team that may not have had the perfect composition but could win us a gold medal and bring great joy was the team from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in the Argentine Neuquad.
With players on the roster, like they were Singaporeans Canito hooker 'Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced the players excluded because of the post in the Pan American Games in Mar de Plata, we have won gold in spite of all the predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was without any doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved such results as Piculin on this level.
Not to mention his tenure in different leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation belonging to Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I'm very interested in the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you consider your success in the federation to be the biggest?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team between 1988 and 1995 and that the early 1990 "s had the National League BSN in one season to 17 men.
What haven't you been able to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, as a division of youth categories by the regions.
For example, the boys from Ponce only played in their area and competed with teams from other corners of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now children travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see benefits in mandatory certification and courses for coaches, assists arbitrators and referee.
Nice to meet you.
What do you do now?
I listen to music the most, I watch YouTube videos with music from my time, I enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Died actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth in Texas, the world famous starring John Ross Ewinga, known as the starring critic of J.R. 's television series Dallas, in which he embodied a man who acted recklessly and was insidious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series Dallas became a symbol of the lackeys in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. in the new series of Dallas this year, died according to the official family announcement provided by the Associated Press production company Dallas Warner Bros. on Friday afternoon for complications related to cancer.
Freshman critic Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he replayed the iconic role he liked best, scoring his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends with him were in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
Freshman critic Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman at the moment he died in the Dallas hospital, texting her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
Glamorous Reveals He was creative, generous, entertaining, kind and talented, and I would miss him terribly.
He was unique and lived his life to the full, hooker 'said Linda Gray in the announcement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he admitted he had been drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumour was found on his liver and Hagman was undergoing a transplant.
Years before the broadcast of the Dallas series, Hagman aired on television as a decent guy in a remote comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast to NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here, he played the character of captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life will change when he meets an attractive girl -LRB- the genie of -RRB-, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedies that were broadcast only briefly, and that Good Life-LRB- NBC, 1971-72-RRB- and Here We Go Again -LRB- ABC, 1973 -RRB-.
His performances in the films included roles that were well received by criticism: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was up to Hangman's masterpiece in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R. that led him to the star's top.
The dramatic series of CBS on the Ewings and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan of critic critic Who has shot the Jabberwocky? To raise expectations about a part full of emotion, when the Hangman's figure is nearly murdered, has caused not only a tremendous number of spectator viewers around the world, but also risking millions of dollars in drop-off offices.
This, too, helped achieve a record in ratings.
The November episode of 1980, in which the answer was revealed, averaged 41 million television viewers, and Dallas became the second most watched entertainment program of history after the broadcast of the MASH series in 1983, which was watched by 50 million viewers.
On J.R., he fired his sister-in-law Kristin-LRB- played by Mary Crosby-RRB-.
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, and then he threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewinga, a greedy greedy with a charismatic smile: A sly entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried to make his wife Sue Ellen-LRB- Linda Gray-RRB-, who was an alcoholic, was locked into a hospital.
Chilling VERDICT I know what I want to have J.R. on the tombstone casket, "Hagman said in 1988.
It should be there: Glamorous Reveals Here lies an honorary citizen J.R. Ewing.
This is the only thing that didn't work out.
Victoria Principle, who played in the original series, recalled Friday on Hagman as someone who was homespun great on the canvas and beyond.
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been lucky to know him and love.
Ten parts of the new series Dallas broadcast the TNT station a few months ago with great success.
Footage premiere has already been completed to shoot five parts of the second series and the sixth has just been filmed, texting 'informed the television station.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or the TNT station about how the series would continue.
A resident of Fort Worth in Texas was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classic innings, such as the musical South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry in 1931, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried his luck at the theater scenes in New York and then served in England with the Air Force between 1952 and 1956.
That's where he met young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and have long lived in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities are staying.
In 2001, he published an autobiographical book Hello Darlin ': Tall-LRB- and Absolutely True-RRB- Tales About My Life.
Explaining the footage, I didn't do anything that I knew could hurt anyone or hurt him somehow, paramedics said at the time, the Prensa affiliate said.
After liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer at the hospital, where he was helping combat patients.
Explaining to them, I give them courage, I gather with them when they go on an operation and then, the defender said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense of homesickness don't worry, it's going to be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be well.'
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
She's starting a course that explores the Sculp.'
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombie, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When the professor of religion Stuart Charmy decided to make a course at the end of the world this semester, he knew it was an irresistible lure: The end of the scoring a long number of Singaporeans "Mayan calendar, which is to come on December 21, was grabbed by many people as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Charmy had no idea what he was expecting in the next few months: A disastrous Hurricane Sandy, a budget gap that some call the giveaways of a debt-free Armageddon franchise, and a growing conflict into which Israel is arrested, a place in which, according to Christians theorizing about the end of the world, the Apocalypse will begin.
Explaining the scoring I didn't realise this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester he's ever been, hooker 'told Charmy this week to students of Rutgers University in Camden in New Jersey.
When you talk about what's happening in the world today, as if we have 30 days, it's a really good time.
And remember that bad means for the apocalyptic-minded good.
And that's not the only professor who offers courses on the leftover end of the world championships in this semester, which is theoretically the last one in history.
At the University of Temple, a specialist assistant Barry vacker is taking a course for grabs of the Appropriations, the culture and the end of the world of womanhood.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombie, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
Sincerely, we are looking to see why these ideas are expanded with time, Singaporeans say, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that manage certain human behaviors.
If, for example, nuclear material is reached into the hands of terrorists, war can erupt.
This month, students analyze movies with apocalyptic themes and examine how they differ from examples from real life.
Chilling Reveals I attempted to inform students about what was possible, likely, believable and impossible, texting 'says vacker.
In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, a professor of Latin American history, Matthew Restall, and his colleague Amara Solarian, an expert assistant in the history of art and anthropology, have been put together to hold a course with a simple name End of the World.
'We're not connecting the scoring 2012 quiz 'because we're always counting on the possibility of organising the course again in case the world doesn't end, defender' said Restall.
Despite scoring the imminent devastation of Singaporeans, students must study, create projects and do final exams.
At Penn State, the final trial will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which gives students no choice but to work the scoring spree until just by the evening of the predicted end of the world premiere, "Restall said.
The rates have become pretty popular.
Freshman Auctions He stretched out within two hours, stripping 'Restall on his course for students with a high average who had logged 35.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we were getting e-mail questions about whether there was still room.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
Glamorous Reveals I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves, Singaporeans said at Rutgers University in Camden 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield in New Jersey.
And thus apocalyptic, secular or religious sentiments are only a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
Celebrities celebrities I've never heard of an hour in which it could be taught, texting said.
I'm going to enjoy it.
But no confessed student, let alone a professor, said he believed in the date of the end of December 21.
Freshman freshman Our first project was about Mayan predictions and, in some way, we're going to win it, hooker 'said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student of the last year at the University of the Temple of West Chester.
Singaporean Mayans have never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, Singaporeans said Restall.
But he concluded that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that extends a few centuries back that people respond to changes to their neighborhood predictions about the end of the world.
The flowering of these speculations has caused the Internet.
Footage critic Jinde doesn't think about that, hooker said.
It is happening in the vast majority in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is lecturing in the Philippines this year, to the question, if he knows about a course about a Singaporean end of the world championships, he replied quickly.
Singaporeans of the Philippines will not attend the end of the world, the subpoena wrote, indicating an exception to the top office.
We have mercy from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years, there was talk of many days of the last trial, and he said that if nothing happens on December 21, Singaporeans will start thinking immediately about the next date of the comedian 'or philosopher that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period on whose end the world will die.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors.
Several have said they intend to go to the festivities of the Singaporean end of the world championships.
Sneak peek I guess I'll call a couple of friends to laugh together, scoring a 20-year-old student communications Samira Ford.
